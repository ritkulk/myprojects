A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


*La categoric qui s'est iixt^rcssec aux sciences comprcnd huit 
peuples: les Indous, les Perses, les Chaldeens, les H^breux, 
les Hellenes, les les Egyptiens et les Arabes. ... La 
premiere nation, (qui ail cultive les sciences) est celle des Indous. 
Elle est fort importante, tres nombreuse, formde de royaumes 
puissants. On la connait pour sa sagesse et tons les peuples 
disparus, toutes les generations passees temoignent qu’elle 
s’est distinguee dans les diverses branches du savoir. . . . Les 
Indous, entre toutes les nations, k travers les siecles et depuis 
I’Antiquite, furent la source de la sagesse, de la justice et de 
la moderation. Ils furent un peuple donne de vertus ponde- 
ratrices, creature de pensees sublimes, d’apologues universels, 
d’inventions rares et de traits d’esprit remarquables.’

PREFACE 


There is a world-wide interest in the study of the history of science 
today as one important aspect in understanding man's cultural patterns. 
This book attempts to present a concise account of the development of 
science in one of the most ancient culture areas of the world. Despite 
vicissitudes in intellectual and scientific endeavours and periods of stagna- 
tion. e.g. about the time of the Renaissance in Europe, the Indian sub- 
continent is one of the few areas where a fairly continuous tradition in 
science and technology is clearly seen. 

Growing interest in Indological research from the end of the eighteenth 
century saw new approaches to oriental studies. Anquetil du Perron and 
Sir William Jones, among several others, were pioneers in this field. The 
seardh for and the discovery of manuscripts, their patient study, attempts 
at correlation with the relics of antiquity brought to light by the archaeo- 
logist's spade and efforts to understand developments in one culture area 
in the light of those of other culture areas in contemporary periods 
characterized this orientation. The linguists, the philologists and the 
general historians trained in the liberal arts, who led the way, were 
naturally attracted to the vast sacerdotal and canonical texts, law books, 
epics, drama and literature. These were more than sufficient to absorb 
their energies. The study of ancient and medieval Indian technology and 
science which involved the methods of the linguist and the philologist and 
the knowledge of scientific disciplines had at first to be slow and halting. 
Nevertheless, such studies were developing and making important con- 
tributions to the understanding of the progress of science in ancient and 
medieval India. The history of Indian science, however, was a far cry 
until after World War 11. 

The genesis of the current interest in the history of science may be 
traced to the Symposium on the History of Sciences in South-East Asia 
held in Delhi in 1950 under the joint auspices of the UNESCD and the 
Indian National Science Academy (then the National Institute of Sciences 
of India). The Symposium emphasized the need for an integrated study 
of the history of science in India and for straightening out the chronological 
problems. It favoured the co-operation of scientists and historians in an 
area of endeavour where the methods of their divergent disciplines could 
be most fruitfully applied. 

After a period of initial deliberations and discussions among its 
Fellows, the Academy set up a History of Science Board and, with the 



VI 


PREFACE 


funds provided by the Government of India in the then Ministry of 
Scientific Research and Cultural Affairs^ started research units for the 
collection and study of source materials for the eventual compilation, in 
several volumes, of the History of Sciences in India. During 1964-65, the 
Board was replaced by a National Commission composed of a number of 
scientists and historians in keeping with the recommendations of the 1950 
Symposium. 

While the Academy, through its History of Science Board and the 
National Commission, was thus busy in developing the foundation of study 
and research in the history of science, the universities and educational 
institutions evinced a growing interest in the teaching of the subject, and 
a number of institutions included it in their curricula. From its inception, 
the National Commission was keenly aware that the universities should 
take an active interest in introducing teaching and research in the history 
of science and made a number of recommendations in that direction. In 
such circumstances, the publication of a concise history of science in India 
was considered to be an effective way of stimulating further appreciation 
among the universities in encouraging teaching in the subject apart from 
generating interest in this new discipline among scholars, scientists and 
general readers. 

The editors are conscious of the limitations of their attempt involving 
the participation of a number of scholars from different fields. Certain 
lack of uniformity in the treatment and presentation of the materials is 
perhaps unavoidable. Nevertheless, it has given an opportunity to such 
scholars to look at the history of science in India from the viewpoint of 
their own disciplines. The original draft of each chapter was referred to 
other experts for comments and suggestions for further improvement, which 
were freely given. Many of these suggestions bearing on the factual state- 
ments were incorporated and comments concerning points of view were 
considered in such a manner that the freedom of authors in this respect was 
not interfered with. The editors take this opportunity to express their 
gratitude to the referees— Prof. Ram Ballabh, Shri T. S. Kuppanna Sastry, 
Prof. Ram Behari, Dr. C. Dwarkanath, Hakim Abdul Wahab Zahuri. 
Prof. T. R. Seshadri, Prof. P. Ray. Shri B. B. Lai, the late Dr. J. C. Sen- 
gupta and Dr. G. S. Melkote. 

The drafts of the various chapters developed in the aforesaid manner 
were considered by the Commission at one of its meetings early in 1970. 
The Commission suggested, inter alia, the incorporation of an introductory 
chapter containing a survey of source materials, rationalization and avoid- 
ance of duplication of the treatment of sources, citations of references in 
the form of footnotes and preparation of a consolidated bibliography, 
covering both primary and secondary sources, and a r6sum6 highlighting 
the main achievements in a chronological setting. The editors executed 
these tasks in consultation with four historian members of the National 
Commission. Prof. R. S. Sharma. Prof. G. R. Sharma. Prof. S. Nurul Hasan

and Prof. Satish Chandra, and received from them valuable suggestions in 
the course of this work, for which they record their thanks. The editors' 
thanks are also due to Prof. Sukumar Roy, formerly Head of the Depart- 
ment of Islamic Studies and Culture, University of Calcutta, for going 
through the draft manuscript, particularly sections dealing with the med- 
ieval period, and making a number of useful suggestions. Prof. F. C. 
Auluck, Member-Secretary of the National Commission, read the draft of 
individual chapters. The editors would like to thank him for his many 
suggestions and for facilitating the progress of the work in various ways. 

Both in the course of the writing of the chapters and their editing, 
the editors received ungrudging co-operation from a number of institutions 
and persons in the matter of references, books and journals, drawings and 
sketches and many technical points. While it is not possible to list all 
of them by name, particular mention may be made of the Asiatic Society 
Library, the National Library, the Library of the Indian National Archives, 
the Archaeological Survey of India, the Zoological Survey of India, the 
Botanical Survey of India, the India Meteorological Department, the 
Geological Survey of India, Dr. B. Biswas. Dr. Y. P. Rao, Shri M. V. A. 
Sastry, Shri M, N. Deshpande, Shri S. R. Rao, Shri M. C. Joshi. Dr. S. P. 
Gupta, Prof. G. S. Dikshit and Dr. R. N. Kapil. To all of them, including 
those not specifically mentioned, the editors place on record their sincere 
thanks for their valuable co-operation and help. 

Special thanks are due to Dr. A. K. Bag. Miss Mira Roy, Miss Mamata 
Chowdhuri and Shri Vijay Govind, Research Fellows in History of Science 
under the National Commission, for rendering all kinds of assistance, 
particularly in the preparation of the consolidated bibliography, the check- 
ing of references and going through the proofs, and to Mrs. Sandhya Mitra, 
Assistant Editor of the Indian Journal of History of Science and other 
publications of the Academy, for seeing the entire matter through the press. 
The editors deeply appreciate the typing and administrative assistance 
given by Shri S. K. Sandbar, Shri B. N. Chakraburtty and Shri S. K. Roy. 

Finally, the editors record their sincere thanks to the Baptist Mission 
Press, particularly to its energetic Works Manager Shri G. Banerjee and his 
assistants, for their meticulous care and interest in the printing of the book.

A SURVEY OF SOURCE MATERIALS 

S. N. Sen 


The source materials on the basis of which attempts have been made in 
this book to present a connected account of the development of science 
in India largely comprise archaeological findings, the vast range of the 
Sanskrit literature originating from the Vedic times, the canonical as well 
as the secular literature of the Buddhists and the Jainas, Arabic and Persian 
works, and secondary sources representing scholarly studies, interpretations 
and analyses of these materials. The scientific and technical writings, 
both primary and secondary, have formed the main basis of discussions of 
the various sciences, and as such these have been treated, along with their 
scientific and technical contents, in the respective chapters. Here, for the 
sake of completeness, we shall do no more than mention some important 
texts. 

The position is quite different with regard to sacerdotal texts, canonical 
literature, philosophical compendia, encyclopaedic works like the Bfhat- 
samhitOy Artha§astra (work on polity), epics, puranas^ lexicographies and 
so on in which scientific matters and concepts appear incidentally, mixed 
up with the non-scientific, but which are nevertheless exceedingly important 
from the point of view of the history of the development of scientific 
ideas. The scientific contents and their analyses will, however, appear in 
their proper places in the chapters concerned, but in this survey we shall 
give an account of such general sources, including the archaeological, and 
their chronological position, so that we may not have to refer to them again 
and again. 


ARCHAEOLOGICAL SOURCES 

The archaeologist’s spade has turned up objects of great value 
pertaining to prehistoric, protohistoric and historical periods. Here our 
main concern will be with pre- and protohistory and consequently with 
objects typical of these periods, which throw light on the various arts and 
techniques from which later scientific practices and methods developed.

A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


The terms ‘prehistory’ and ‘protohistory’ and the various cultural divisions 
within them require some clarification. The beginning of the historical 
period is now generally determined by the advent of written documents of 
historical character such as the A^okan edicts, in other words, the history 
of a people begins from when they have become literate and mastered the 
art of writing. Accordingly, accounts of all cultures in which writing has 
not yet appeared should come under ‘prehistory*. Such a definition as 
far as concerns the Indian subcontinent is fraught with serious difficulties. 
The Harappan civilization, for example, is marked by a kind of 
writing, albeit undeciphered, and the builders of that civilization can by 
no means be called illiterate. Furthermore, how should we describe the 
account of a people who orally transmitted the literary tradition of the 
Vedas for several centuries since the second millennium B.c.— a tradition 
rich in near historical materials but committed to writing at a much later 
date? To resolve these difficulties, the term ‘protohistory’ is now used 
to cover the civilization of the Indus valley, the Vedic civilization and the 
various chalcolithic cultures either contemporaneous with, or successors 
to, the Indus civilization.® The term ‘ prehistory ’ is then reserved for the 
Stone Age cultures for the understanding of which we have no guideline 
other than stone (and bone) implements. 

About the various prehistoric cultures, terms like ‘palaeolithic’, 

‘ mesolithic ’, ‘ neolithic ‘ Bronze Age ’, etc., used in the context of the 
European and the Mediterranean world, are not quite applicable to the 
Indian subcontinent owing to differences in cultures and teehniques. We 
have abundant evidence of Stone Age cultures from the time of the inter- 
glacial periods of the Pleistocene, and it is now thought more appropriate 
to describe them as Early, Middle and Late Stone Age on the basis of the 
major types of stone industries. There is not much difficulty in using the 
term ‘neolithic’ to designate the cultures characterized by some kind of 
mixed farming, domestication of animals, use of potteries, building of 
dwellings and so on in which stone is still the material of the tools and 
implements used. In India, the stone-using farm cultures and the metal- 
using (copper and bronze) ones are not sharply delineated, the term ‘chalco- 
lithic’ being applied to metal-using farm cultures. On account of the 
coexistence of both the cultures, the period is often described as the ‘neo- 
lithic-chalcolithic’. The term ‘Bronze Age’ cannot be used in India in 
the same sense in which it is meaningful for the Mediterranean world 
and elsewhere although bronze found use in the subcontinent at quite an 
early date and became the distinctive feature of the Harappan culture. 
The Harappan culture, the so-called Indus Valley Civilization, extended 
as recent researches have revealed, much beyond the limits of the Indus 
valley, and in this context pre-Harappan and post-Harappan cultures are 
now used to follow the sequence.

Within the broad neolithic-chalcolithic framework, cultural differen- 
tiation as well as affinities are often sought to be made by pottery types 
such as handmade, wheel-thrown and wheel-turned, with painted deco- 
rations varying from monochrome to polychrome, typical of pre-Harappan 
Baluchistan, Black and Red wares of Harappan and post-Harappan Lothal, 
Ahar, Rangpur, Prakash and many other sites, technologically innovated 
Lustrous Red wares believed to be evolved from Harappan types and found 
in chalcolithic Saurashtra, and finally the Painted Grey and Northern 
Black Polished wares associated with an Iron Age in India and turned up 
at Atranjikhera, Hastinapur, Alamgirpur and other sites in the Doab. 


The Stone Age 

Of the three phases of the Indian Stone Age, the Early is dominated by 
the hand-axe, the cleaver and core tools, the Middle by the flakes includ- 
ing scrapers, burins and blades, and the Late by microliths of various 
types. Quartzite pebbles, stone outcrops and boulders, cryptocrystalline 
silica like agate, jasper or chalcedony provided the main materials for the 
stone industries. Some of the Early Stone Age sites include the Soan (or 
Sohan) and the Beas valley in the Panjab, Adamgarh Hill and Bhera Ghat 
near Jabalpur in the Narbada valley, the Gudiyam Cave at Attirampakkam 
near Madras, Wainganga River sites, Nevasa on the Godavari, Khandivli 
near Bombay and a few other places. Most of the sites mentioned above 
have also revealed Middle Stone Age flake industries. The Late Stone 
Age sites are widespread throughout the Indian subcontinent. Gujarat 
(Langhnaj), Central India (Adamgarh, Barasimha, Nimkhera, Sakri, etc.), 
the region between the Central Indian hills and the Gangetic plains (Bara- 
kaccha, Sidhpur, Lekhania in Mirzapur district, and Morhana Pahar), 
Birbhanpur on the Damodar in West Bengal, and south India (Raichur, 
Jalahalli, Kibbanahalli, Nagaijunakonda and Belgaum) are particularly 
rich in Late Stone Age sites. Adamgarh alone has yielded 25,000 micro- 
liths. The Old Stone Age sites in Kashmir and Panjab are related to inter- 
glacial periods of late Pleistocene (150000 B.C.), the Middle Stone Age 
cultures which are often mixed with the later phase of the former flourished 
around c. 25000 b.c., while the Late Stone Age emerged definitely during 
the post-Pleistocene and merged with the Neolithic.® C^^ dating of shells 
from Adamgarh carried out at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research 
has placed the beginning of the Late Stone Age in that area at 5500 b.c. 
At Lekhania, the Late Stone Age flourished as late as 1710 B.c. Our main 
sources of Indian Stone Age cultures are the pioneering investigations of 
R. B. Foote and F. R. Allchin in South India and Gujarat, H. de Terra 
and T. T. Paterson in Kashmir, the Panjab and Central India, L. A. 
Cammiade and M. C. Burkitt in South India, K. R. U. Todd for the Bombay 
region, R. V. Joshi for Adamgarh and other Madhya Pradesh sites.

Pre-Harappan Cultures 

Pre-Harappan cultures in various stages of evolution have recently 
assumed clearer perspective as a result of intensive archaeological activity 
in Baluchistan, Sind, the Panjab and Rajasthan. In north Baluchistan, 
earliest settlements have been found in Kili Ghul Mohammad and Damb 
Sadaat in the Quetta valley by Fairservis and at Rana Ghundai mound in 
the Loralai valley by Ross, all showing a number of periods. Pd. I of Kili 
Ghul Mohammad dated 3688 and 3712 by methods produced no 
pottery nor metal objects, Pd. II yielded handmade pottery and Pd. Ill 
both handmade and wheel- turned pottery as well as copper.® Damb 
Sadaat, excavated by Fairservis, shows three periods, with somewhat contin- 
uous development, dating from 2528 or 2625 b.c. for Pd. I and 2554, 2425 
or 2220 B.c. for Pd. II. Wheel-turned pottery, terracotta figurines and 
copper objects (Pd. II and III) are among some of the finds. Rana Ghundai 
excavated by Ross yielded a complete sequence through a number of periods. 

At Anjira and Siah-damb in the Surab valley in central Baluchistan, 
de Cardi unearthed similar neolithic settlements having pottery affinities 
with Damb Sadaat. Further south, Nal, in Kalat State, settled somewhat 
later than northern and central sites, produced distinctive types of pottery, 
copper objects and evidence of lead smelting. 

These earliest settlements in semi-arid and mountainous Baluchistan 
in the subcontinent show unmistakable cultural affinities, as, for example, 
Damb Sadaat I with Kili Ghul Mohammad IV, Anjira III with Damb 
Sadaat II-III, Anjira II with Kili Ghul Mohammad II and III, Nal with 
Rana Ghundai III and so on. The most important, however, is the 
relationship of these settlements with the earlier neolithic settlement at 
Mundigak in south Afghanistan, which reveals a progressive evolution in 
culture, through periods I to IV, in pottery types from wheel-made to wheel- 
turned with varying designs and motifs, in the appearance of copper in 
Pd. I 2 , bronze in Pd. IIIq, stone seals and in the development of some kind of 
township with walls and bastions with sun-dried bricks. In some of these 
features, Mundigak IV corresponds to Damb Sadaat III and Rana Ghundai 
ni^, Mundigak II-III to Damb Sadaat I-III, Mundigak IV to Nal, whereas 
in its later phase, Mundigak itself bears the impress of the Harappan 


« By Pd. I, Pd. II, etc., are meant period I, period II, etc., the Roman numbers in 
ascending order indicating later dates. In several cases, dates of these archaeological 
periods have been given.

culture. Some of the radiocarbon datings for Mundigak are : Pd. Ij— 2113 
B.c.:Pd. Ill— 2360 B.c. 

As we move from Baluchistan to the Indus valley, we come across a 
number of sites, c.g. Amri excavated by Majuradar and later by Casal, 
Kot Diji explored by the Pakistan Archaeological Department, and Kali- 
bangan" on the Ghaggar excavated by Lai and Thapar, and the pre-defence 
layers of Harappa itself. All these sites present the pre-Harappan phase 
in a more marked manner. A line dark, purple-red ware is the character- 
istic feature of all these sites. At Amri, different phases of period I show 
affinities with Anjira III, Kili Ghul Mohammad III-IV and Mundigak III, 
while during period II Harappan types appear. Kot Diji, about 30 miles 
east of Mohenjo-daro, at its levels of earliest settlements, reveals pottery 
types akin to Mundigak III and IV and Anjira IIl-IV and, at later levels, a 
mixed culture in which the Harappan is predominant. Radiocarbon 
datings carried out at the University of Pennsylvania are 2605 B.c. and 
2472 B.c. for the early period and 2335 b.c., 2255 b.c. for the later period. 
At Kalibangan, the Harappan citadel phase is preceded by the pre-Harappan 
settlement characterized by steatite beads, shell bangles, some pottery 
types resembling those of Amri and Kot Diji, and a few copper and bronze 
objects as rarities. datings determined by the TF on a large number 
of samples from Kalibangan place its pre-Harappan phase between 2371 
B.c. and 2098 B.c. although a few lower dates have also been found. 


Harappan Culture : The Bronze Age Civilization of the Indus Valley 


The brilliant series of excavations started by Daya Ram Sahni at 
Harappa in 1921 and by R. D. Banerjee at Mohenjo-daro during 1922—23 
and followed up by Vats, Dikshit, Marshall, Hargreaves, Mackay and 
Majumdar led to the exciting discovery of the protohistoric Harappan 
culture which up to 1947 or so was believed to have been confined within 
the narrow strip of the Indus valley. Archaeological explorations carried 
out during the post-Independence period have now resulted in the extension 
of this civilization over an area of about 840,000 square miles.*’ Besides 
the Indus valley proper, this area now includes East Panjab and Uttar Pradesh 
almost up to Delhi, northern Rajputana in the former State of Bikaner, 
Cutch, Saurashtra and Gujarat up to the mouth of the Narbada and' 
the Makran coastal area in South Baluchistan up to Sutkagen Dor near the 
Iranian frontier. Over 70 sites, large and small, have so far yielded remains of 
this once extensive culture, of which some of the important ones of recent dis- 
covery include Ruparo on the Sutlej in the Himalayan foothiUs, AlamgirpuP* 
m Meerut district, Kalibangan' in northern Rajasthan, Desalpar'^ in 
Cutch. LothaP and Rojdi* in Saurashtra, Kot Diji and Amri in Sind.

The general characteristics of this civilization as enumerated by 
Wheeler (3) include a thick red-slipped ware in cylindrical and goblet shapes, 
intersecting circles, pipal leaves, rosettes, and peacocks as motifs, Indus 
seals and script, triangular terracotta cakes, kidney-shaped inlays of shell 



or faience, metal tool types, and town planning according to a gridiron 
scheme of streets and houses. A cultural uniformity, unquestionable 
technical competence, if dull, and a flare for standardization are noticeable 
in all areas of activity — in the making of bricks, in sanitary arrangements, 
in pottery, in the wide range of copper and bronze tools, vessels and human 
and animal figurines, and seal-cutting from steatite blocks. In this effort- 
less competence of which evidence has survived in archaeological remains 
of all descriptions, one can see the picture of city-centered prosperous agri- 
cultural communities thriving on wheat, barley, sesamum and mustard, 
animal husbandry, an industry of woven cotton, various arts and crafts and 
an extensive trade, all rendered possible by an efficient central government

with capitals, defensive city outposts, docks and harbours. The Harappan 
inscriptions, now numbering about 2,500, have so far defied several attempts 
at decipherment. B. B. Lai (5) has shown the direction of writing from 
right to left. It is still an open question if the language belonged to 
the Indo-European or the Dravidian family, but recent computer studies 
carried out in Copenhagen by a team of Finnish scholars indicate a 
preference for the latter.® 

Marshall’s estimate of 3250-2750 B.c. as the period of the Harappan 
culture was already scaled down to 2350-1770 b.c. by C. J. Gadd on the 
basis of cross-datings with the Sargonic and Isin-Larsa periods. Wheeler’s 
(3) dating of 2500-1500 B.c. for the entire Harappan span, first suggested 
in 1946, remained generally accepted up to 1962. Radiocarbon datings 
largely carried out at the TF and recently analyzed by Agrawal have 
introduced further refinements in the above date-brackets. Some of these 
datings are given below

From a careful analysis of these and other radiocarbon data, D. P. 
Agrawal (2) concluded that for the metropolitan Mohenjo-daro the 
maximum spread might be taken as 2300 to 2000 B.c. and for the peripheral 
regions 2200 to 1700 b.c. would be best indicated by these findings.

Neolithic-Chalcolithic Cultures outside the Harappan limits 

What was happening in the rest of India when cultural evolution was 
taking place in the western regions of the subcontinent culminating in the 
brilliant Harappan phase between the fourth millennium to the middle of 
the second millennium b.c.? Until Wheeler’s work at Brahmagiri during 
1947 - 48 , northern, central, southern and eastern India formed the 
archaeological terra incognita, contrary to expectations raised by many 
references in the Sanskrit and the Buddhist literature. During the last 
20 years, archaeological excavations in these regions have established the 
existence of neolithic and chalcolithic cultures in all these areas as is naturally 
to be expected from the extensive Stone Age cultures prevailing in pre- 
historic times in these very regions. In Kashmir, Burzahom® gave evidence 
of a neolithic site, dated c. 2375 by the method, whose stone and bone 
implements, coarse handmade pottery, pit dwellings, and dog burial custom 
indicated Burzahom’s inspiration from China. This is also true of the 
neolithic settlements of Assam in the Garo and Naga Hills. 

In south India where Brahmagiri gave the first indication, neolithic 
settlements have been discovered at Sanganakallu,*^ Piklihal,^ Maski,*^ 
Utnur, Tekkalakota,® Hallur,-^ T. Narsipur,^ Hemmige, Nagarjunakonda 
and other places, all in Andhra-Karnatak and at Paiyampalli, Gaurimedu 
and Mangalam in the Tamilnad. Radiocarbon datings indicate the 
comparative lateness of the South Indian neolithic complex, say, between 
2000 B.c. and 1485 b.c. One of the samples from Utnur gave as early a 
date as c. 2295 b.c. Narsipur and Tekkalakota gave 1805 and 1780 b.c. 
Paiyampalli, Sanganakallu, and later phases of Narsipur and Tekkalakota 
appeared between 1485 and 1615 b.c. Sequential changes from core and 
flake tradition and simple handmade pottery to more developed wheel- 
thrown pottery and adoption of copper and bronze tools in the late 
phase are clearly noticeable. Sankalia thought that Raichur and Bellary 
were probably the original focus of neolithic cultures in South-east India 
and stimulated the development of similar cultures in Andhra-Karnatak 
and Tamilnad regions.* Allchin favours Daimabad in Maharashtra as 
a focal point which in its turn received inspiration from the Harappan 
cultures and even from Burzahom as far as early pottery is concerned.* 

More interesting perhaps are the post-Harappan phases, mixed with 
local cultures, discovered in Saurashtra, Maharashtra, south-east Rajasthan 
and Malwa, the Panjab and the Gangetic Doab. In Saurashtra, the 
Harappan phase noticed in Lothal, Rojdi and Desalpar yielded to a post- 
Harappan phase in Lothal II (1900-1500 B.c.) and Rojdi IB (1800 b.c.).

To these sites may be added Rangpur,® Prabhas Patan (Somnath),** Bhagat- 
rav and a few other places. In all of them, after an initial decline 
of the Harappan culture, a new revival is noticeable as in the Black and 
Red pottery styles and the appearance of the Lustrous Red wares. At 
Rangpur, rice cultivation appears in Pd. IIA (2000-1750 b.c.) and millet in 
Pd. Ill (1200-1000 B.C.). In the concluding phase of Prabhas Patan, iron 
appears around 1000 b.c. At Lothal and Rojdi, this period possibly 
commenced after 1800 b.c. and 1745 b.c. respectively; at other places the 
period might be somewhat later. 

The Banasian culture of Ahar^ and Gilund^^ in the Banas river valley 
in south-east Rajasthan is distinctive in its absence of a stone industry of 
any kind in its earlier phases and in the presence of numerous copper 
objects, particularly axes made of locally available copper. Black and 
R^ wares are predominant, with Lustrous Red wares appearing in later 
phases. Radiocarbon datings carried out in the University of Victoria, 
Australia, would indicate the beginning of the Ahar culture around c. 1990 
to 2144 B.C., whereas some late dates, 1727, 1552, 1273 b.c., are indicated 
by samples analyzed at the TF. According to Allchin, the Banasian phase 
might have extended from 1800 to 1400 b.c.® 

Further south-east lies the Malwa plateau between the Chambal and 
the Narbada. Here Navdatoli,-^ Nagda and a few other sites have revealed 
four to three phases and a cultural evolution from a stone blade industry, 
through cultivation of wheat, rice (first evidence from Navdatoli), lentil 
and oil-seeds and animal husbandry involving cattle, sheep, goat and pig, 
to a copper using phase. Black and Red pottery is predominant, later on 
absorbing the Jorwe tradition of spouted pots. Navdatoli^s chalcolithic 
period, IIIA to HID, has now been put down to 1657-1443 b.c. on the 
basis of Pennsylvania University’s datings.^ 

In the north-western part of the Deccan plateau, traversed by the 
Narbada and the Tapti flowing westward and the upper reaches of the 
Godavari and the Krishna flowing eastward, a series of chalcolithic sites 
have been unearthed and studied by the Archaeological Department of 
the Deccan College, Poona. These sites are Prakash,'^ BahaP and Tekwada 
in the Tapti valley, Daimabad^ and Nevasa*^ in the upper reaches of the 
Godavari, Sonegao* near the Krishna, Nasik,^ Jorwe”^ and Chandoli’* 
on the plateau itself. An integrated study of this group of Maharashtrian 
sites has brought to light a number of phases. Diamabad I presents the 
earliest phase having cultural affinities with Saurashtra and Malwa as

also with the upper neolithic phase of Karnatak. Stone axes, perforated 
ring-stone, a stone blade industry and a coarse grey pottery form the cultural 
complex of the first phase. In the second phase represented by Daimabad 
II and Prakash I A, copper knife blades, a fine reddish-brown ware and 
Malwa type spouted wares appear. Jorwe, Nevasa, Chandoli and Sonegao 
which represent the third phase yield a variety of both stone and copper 
implements, painted red Jorwe wares with spouts, some Lustrous Red 
wares, and fibres of cotton, flax and silk. datings on samples from 
Sonegao put the Jorwe phase between 1375 and 1290 B.c.; the second 
phase (Daimabad II, Prakash lA) may be placed between c. 1700 and 
1400 B.c. by comparison with Navdatoli IIIB and IIIC, and the first 
Daimabad phase before 1800 b.c. 

The penetration of the Harappan culture in its latest phase into the 
Ganges-Jamuna Doab is attested by Alamgirpur. While a post-Harappan 
phase was persisting in Saurashtra, south-east Rajasthan and a few other 
places, this culture disappeared from the Doab. In its place we find the 
emergence of a new chalcolithic phase dominated by the use of a variety of 
copper implements. Several copper hoards— B. B. Lal« counted some 37— 
have been discovered in the Doab and in the Chota Nagpur Hills in Eastern 
India, of which some important sites include Bahadarabad in Saharanpur 
district, Rajpur Parsu, Bisauli, Fatehgarh, Santal Parganas, Baragunda, 
Saguna and others. An interesting point is the association of ochre coloured 
pottery with the copper hoard culture in these areas, which is now receiving 
closer investigation. The association, in some centres, of copper hoards 
with ochre coloured pottery as in Bisauli and Rajpur and, in some other 
places, their existence below the Painted Grey ware, as in Hastinapur, suggest 
that copper hoards might belong to ochre coloured or some such pottery 
of a pre-Grey Ware period.* As we have already noticed, chalcolithic 
copper implements in varying degrees of abundance have been reported 
from Saurashtra, Rajputana, Central India and the Deccan trap. These 
are largely in the form of flat axe, shouldered celt, antennae sword, dagger, 
ring, etc. 


The Iron Age in India and its Association with Black and Red, the Painted 
Grey and the Northern Black Polished Wares 

Compared to the introduction around 1800 b.c. of an Iron Age either 
in the Caucasus or in Asia Minor by the Hittites who discovered the process 
of smelting iron ores and kept it as a closely guarded secret for several 
centuries, the Iron Age in India is of recent date. About 20 years back 
Col. Gordon could place the beginning of this age not earlier than 250 b.c.

Grey wares, in Ahicchatra" and later on in Hastinapur,*’ Rupar,'" Panipat, 
Indraprastha (Puran Quila), Mathura,^ Bairat, Sonpat, Atranjikhera,* 
Alamgirpur,^ Noh^ and Sravasti, all in the Doab except Noh in Rajasthan, 
and its association with Iron Age occupations, has thrown new light on 
this age and further pushed back its beginnings to around 1100 b.c. This 
grey pottery is made of well-levigated clay, free from impurities, and is 
medium to thin-walled and properly baked. In some of these P.G. ware 
levels, iron finds include, among others, arrow-heads, spearheads and axes in 
different shapes. Further east in the central Gangetic valley, in Kausambi,* 
Rajghat* (old Varanasi), Prahladpur,^ Buxar* and Chirand^ Black and Red 
wares characterize the pottery. No iron object has so far turned up in the 
early period, but in later periods, possibly around 500 b.c., iron appears to 
be introduced. Another interesting feature is the appearance towards the 
end of the P.G. or B. and R. ware phase of a black lustrous pottery called 
the Northern Black Polished ware, dated from 500 B.c. At Atranjikhera, 
the P.G. ware period determined by dating at the Tata Institute of 
Fundamental Research extends from 1025 to 537 b.c.; Hastinapur Pd. II 
gives two dates, 573 and 506 B.c.; Noh (Rajasthan) provides 821 and 
604 B.c. on the basis of radiocarbon dating carried out at the California 
University, Los Angeles; Kausambi yields (TF dating) 500 and 400 b.c.; 
Chirand (B. and R. period) 846 and 769 b.c.; and Sonepur (pre-N.B.P. 
period) 637 b.c. All these indicate a period between 1025 and 500 B.c., in 
which P.G., B. and R. and N.B.P. wares and the associated Iron Age played 
a dominant part. 

In Gujarat, Malwa and Central India, the Iron Age follows the chalco- 
lithic period in a general way. In these areas, iron objects appear in 
association with Black and Red wares, as in Prabhas Patan,^ Nagal," 
Nagara® (old Cambay), Nagda and Ujjain. Black and Red occupation 
levels are followed by N.B.P, wares imported probably from the Gangetic 
valley. This Black and Red ware in India was extensive both in space and 
time, and its full cultural significance is not yet understood. What appears 
to be certain is the dominance of both iron and the Black and Red ware 
about the fifth century b.c.^ 

In peninsular India, Black and Red pottery side by side with iron 
objects and the later N.B.P. phase have been discovered in Prakash II® 
and Bahai II towards the close of the chalcolithic period. Another 
important characteristic of peninsular India as well as of Ceylon is the pit

burial and urn burial, also called ‘megalith’, in which iron objects have 
been found with pottery, stone objects and carnelian beads. These types 
of burial have been known for a long time from the excavations carried out 
between 1851 and 1862 by Meadows Taylor in Shorapur, by Alexander 

Rea between 1899 and 1904 in Adichanallur, and by Hunt between 1916 

and 1924 in Raigir and Bhongir. Recently, Deshpande found three urn 
burials and one pit burial in Tekwada. Brahmagiri,® Piklihal,** Sangana- 
kallu and Maski^^ carry the same type of story. Brahmagiri burial grounds, 
excavated by Wheeler, yielded B. and R. wares, mat-painted red pottery 
similar to Jorwe type and iron objects. Hallur (in south Dharwar) shows 
up an Iron Age fairly early, as indicated by TF radiocarbon datings of 

1105 and 955 b.c. At Piklihal, Sanganakallu and Maski, iron objects, in 

association with copper and sometimes gold, are common in graves as well 
as habitational sites. The large number of south Indian megalithic or urn 
burial sites have yielded Black and Red ware, almost uniform types of iron 
objects — spade, hoe, pick-axe, sickle, wedge, crowbar, spear, knife, dagger, 
sword, chisel, tripod, saucer hook-lamps, occasional copper, bronze or 
stone objects and beads. Some grave types and burial customs, developed 
during the ncolithic-chalcolithic period, are distinctly indigenous; some 
bear similarities with those of Central Asia, Iran or the Caucasus, suggest- 
ing the influence of Indo-Iranian speaking immigrants; while still others 
are reminiscent of practices noticed in the Levant and the south coast of 
Arabia.^^ 


FAIENCE, VITREOUS PASTE, GLAZE AND GLASS 

Faience, vitreous paste, glaze and finally glass and the techniques 
involved in making them appeared during the protohistoric period. 
Faience spindle-whorls side by side with those made of pottery have been 
found in Mohenjo-daro.® From the same Harappan phase we have the 
specimen of a vitreous paste,^ an opaque glassy substance, having a chem- 
ical composition— silica— 8812%, ferric oxide— 3-20%, calcium oxide— 
1-82%, alkali oxides— 5-04% and cupric oxide— 0-46% and a few vitreous 
slabs of carnelian blue colour of more or less the same composition. Such 
vitreous paste and slabs were intended to be ground to powder and then 
used for glazing purposes. Glazed ivory shells, faience and pottery objects 
have been found in Mohenjo-daro. In Egypt, green glazes appear much 
earlier on Badariaii pottery (c, 4000 b.c.) and in Mesopotamia from the 
Jemdet Nasr period (c. 3000 b.c.). 

True glass turns up in India rather late, at the beginning of the historical 
period, whereas this man-made fourth state of matter, in the form of coloured 
beads, are known in Egypt from predynastic graves at Naquada (4000- 
3500 B.C.), Abydos (3500-3250 b.c.), Qau (2600-2500 b.c.) and Dahshur

(2100 B.C.). The art of making glass vessels has been practised in Egypt 
and Mesopotamia from about c. 1500 b.c. The earliest true glass objects in 
India have so far turned up in Taxila® in its three main mounds, Bhir (c. fifth 
century b.c.), Sirkap and Sirsukh and in Kopia in U.P. (fifth century b.c.), 
although references to glass in the Satapatha Brahmana would indicate 
its use in India at a much earlier period. Other finds at Dharmarajika 
Stupa (c. first or second century a.d.), Ahicchatra (c. from a.d. 100 on- 
wards), Chandravalli (c. first century a.d.) and Arikamedu (c. second 
century a.d.) belong to later periods. Kopia** has also yielded evidence of 
glass manufacture at the site itself. Chemical analyses of Indian specimens 
reveal considerable difference from those of contemporary Babylonian, 
Roman or Chinese glass and point to an indigenous industry. It is, 
however, quite possible that the technical know-how was originally derived 
from the craftsmen of this long-established ancient art of West Asia. 


THE VEDIC LITERATURE 

The Vedic literature is the oldest Indian and also the most outstand- 
ing specimen of the earliest Indo-European literary effort. Unlike the 
canonical literature of other great religions, which often represents a com- 
plete collection worked out in some definite time, the Vedas are considered 
to be revealed (sruti) knowledge par excellence handed down from genera- 
tion to generation by a unique method of oral transmission. The whole 
literature has been conveniently divided, according to content and chrono- 
logy in a general way, into three distinct classes, e.g. the Sarphitds, the 
Brdhmanas, and the Aranyakas-Upanisads. Despite this classification, 
there is a great deal of unity and intermixture of materials among the three 
divisions. Chronologically, although the Samhitds are older than the 
Brdhmanas and the Brdhmanas than the Aranyakas-Upanisads, some of the 
Brdhmanas are older than, or contemporaneous with, some of the Sarnhitds, 
and likewise with the Brdhmanas vis-d-vis the Aranyakas-Upanisads. 

The Four Samhitds 

The Samhitds are lyrical collections of hymns, prayers, invocations, 
sacrificial and magical formulas, of which a great variety must have existed 
at one time, depending on the numerous families of the Vedic bards. We 
now possess only four such great collections, e.g. (i) the fgveda, the book 
of strophes (rcas) or hymns and prayers {mantras) to be recited during 
sacrifices and rituals, (ii) the Sdmaveda, the book of melodies (sdmans) in 
accordance with which the fcas are to be sung, (iii) the Yajurveda, the book of 
sacrificial formulas (yajum^i) available again under two distinct groups, the 
Black and the White, and (iv) the Atharvaveda, the book of magical formulas.

A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


The Rgveda 

The Rgveda is the most ancient and important collection comprising 
1,028 hymns and 10,462 teas distributed over 10 mandedas or books. From 
the researches of Bergaigne, Oldenberg, Bloomfield and others, it is now 
well known that these mandalas and the hymns constituting them were 
formulated in different periods— how different or ancient it is impossible to 
say with any definiteness. The books II to VII, for example, contain the 
oldest hymns, and books I and X, containing an assortment of hymns on 
diverse subjects, including the oft-quoted cosmogonic hymns, represent the 
latest collections. Book IX dealing with the glorification of the soma 
drink and carrying forward the soma-c\i\i of the Indo-Iranian period must 
be given high antiquity. The portrayal, in the oldest hymn-books, of a 
simple patriarchal life in small communities on the banks of the Indus, with 
a warm love and adoration of nature and, in the latest books, of an organized 
Brahminical hierarchy already propagating the virtues of a society based on 
caste, penetrating farther east, clearly indicates the great difference of time 
between the primitive origin of the hymns and their redaction into the 
fJc-Samhitd we are familiar with. 

As to sciences, their origins, although couched in mythological forms, 
are traceable in the Rgveda. References to the threefold division of the 
heaven, the sun and the moon, their motions through stellar constellations, 
solar eclipse, division of time in days, months, year, intercalation, etc., 
clearly herald the beginning of astronomy and calendrical science. Interest 
in medicine is reflected in the fact that several of the Vedic gods occasionally 
play the role of physicians providing remedies. The foremost among them 
are the twin brothers Asvins, sometimes also called Nasatyas, who had the 
powers of healing the blind, the thin and the feeble and men with broken 
bones.® Another Vedic god who has something to do with healing is 
Varuoa, the lord and guardian of (ta, the Vedic equivalent of the Indo- 
Aryan word dsa (old Persian, arta), which has been variously interpreted 
as meaning ‘a regular order in general’, ‘moral rectitude’, ‘a true law of the 
universe’ and so on.^ This (ta which is responsible for the orderly func- 
tioning of universal laws such as the fixity of the stars, the movements of 
celestial bodies, etc., also controls matters terrestrial and spiritual, including 
the orderly or disorderly functioning of bodies of human beings on the 
earth. The beginnings of a plant science have been traced in stray references 
to external and internal structures of plants, some physiological processes 
involved in manuring, plant classification and evolution. Regarding agri- 
culture, trade and industry, Winternitz mentions that barley used to be 
cultivated, cattle-rearing formed the main source of income, horse was 
highly prized and harnessed before the chariot in war and peace, and wood- 
workers, cabinet and chariot makers, metal workers, shipbuilders and so 
on formed the main backbone for what passed for industries in Vedic

times.** No less important are the philosophical hymns enquiring about 
the origin of things and of a creator who is variously named as Prajapati, 
Bfhaspati, Vi^vakarman, and ‘ the One*. 

The Samaveda 

The Samaveda is an anthology of the ^veda. The Samhitd has come 
down to us in three recensions or schools, e.g. those of the Kauthumas, 
the Ranayanlyas and the Jaiminiyas or Talavakaras. It is a collection of 
both songs and verses. The majority of the verses are borrowed from the 
figveda, although these are often marked by variations of a linguistic 
character or those due to exigencies of musical adaptations. A source book 
of great importance for the study of the most ancient history of Indian 
music, the Samaveda and its Brdhmanas and Sutras are also full of interest 
from the viewpoint of calendrical astronomy because of their fuller treatment 
of gavdm ayana, the sattras of various durations and other ceremonies 
built round the daily progress of the sun. As a derivative work, the 
Samhitd naturally enough offers no clue towards the determination of its 
date except that it is posterior to the fgveda. 

The Yajurveda 

As a compendium of sacrificial formulas, the Sartihitd of the Yajurveda 
came to be developed in a large number of schools of Adhvaryu priests and 
recensions. Although Patanjali, in the introduction to his Mahdbhdsya, 
mentions 100 schools of the Veda of the Adhvaryus, works of the following 
five schools have come down to us: (a) the Kdthaka or, more correctly, 
the Carayaniya’Katha-Samhitd, representing the main recension of the 
Katha school; (b) the Kapi^thala~{KathaySamhitd, representing another 
recension of the same Kafha school, preserved only in fragments; (c) the 
Maitrdyani’Sarrihitd, of the Maitraya^ilya school; {d) the Taittiriya-Samhitd, 
of the Taittiriya or, more particularly, the Apastamba school; and (e) the 
Vdjasaneyi-Samhitd, after the teacher Yajnavalkya Vajasaneya, in the 
recensions of Kanva and Madhyandina. 

Traditionally, the works of the first four schools are grouped under 
the Black Yajurveda and the last Sarrihitd belongs to the White Yajurveda^ 
but both the groups, on the whole, deal with common materials. As to 
their relationship to the ^veda, both the groups and their recensions 
abound in mantras borrowed from the ^eda^ with, however, many and 
profound variations. The chief difference between the Black and the 
White Yajurveda lies in the fact that, in the former, the mantras are followed 
by, and often intermingled with, theological discussions and explanations, in 
prose, called Brdhmanas, whereas, in the latter, the mantras are carefully 
separated from the Brdhmanas and the materials treated in a more 
systematic manner.

A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


From the geographical data embedded in these texts, it appears that 
the Kalha-Kapiffhala school flourished in Kashmir and the Panjab and the 
Maitrayaniya school in Gujarat, the Taittiriyas had their largest number of 
adherents in South India from where Apastamba and Baudhayana came 
and the sphere of activity of the Vajasaneyins was confined largely in north- 
eastern and eastern parts of India.® Such a distribution of spheres of 
influence of the various Yajus schools was, however, by no means water- 
tight, for there exists clear evidence of the Katha and the Taittiriya schools 
operating in the Madhyade^a as well. 

The verses or fcas which occur in the various recensions of the Yajurveda 
are also found in the ^veda, with the difference that the whole hymns of 
the latter are rarely incorporated in the former. As Winternitz has pointed 
out, the Yajurveda used only single verses, ‘torn from their context, which 
just appeared suitable to some sacrificial ceremony or other . . .’ There is 
hardly any ground for doubting that the various recensions of the Yajurveda 
are posterior to the Ijgveda and that the Sanihitas of the KSfhaka, Kapi- 
sfhala, Maitrayam and Taittiriya schools are older than the Vajasaneyi 
Sarphita, 


The importance of the Yajurveda texts as possessing several passages of 
considerable astronomical significance need hardly be overestimated. While 
the naksatras are doubtless mentioned in the Rgveda, their whole series 
numbering 27 or 28 and headed by Kfttikas turn up for the first time in the 
recensions of the Yajurveda. The gavam ayana and the sattras resembling 
those already given in, and probably taken over from, the Samaveda and 
Its Brahmanas, find lengthy treatment in these Yajus texts. Traces of 
mathematical knowledge are reflected here and there in the enumeration and 
naming of large numbers in multiples of ten, cases of addition, subtraction 
and multiplication, fractions first noticed in the Rgveda and further de- 
veloped in the Maitrdyani Samhita, and progressive series. 

From the point of view of medicine, the Yajurveda texts also contain 
information of importance, though not much different from other Samhitas, 
except of course the Atharvaveda about whose importance in relation to 
medicine we shall say more in what follows. Rudra who is represented in 
the Vedic literature as one possessing great strength and power and as the 
cause of terror is described in the Yajurveda as the first divine physician- 
prathamo daivyo bhi?ak.o This idea is also found in the figveda where this 
error-mspinng Rudra is also famed as the best of all physicians.® About 
die different diseases, the White Yajurveda mentions 100 types of yaksna,

attested in both the Atharvaveda and the Yajurveda,^ A large number of 
plant remedies are recommended for curing diseases in the various recen- 
sions of the Yajurveda, In this connection important references to plant 
structures, physiology and classification are also met with in this Samhitd, 

The Atharvaveda 

The Atharvaveda comprises 731 hymns and about 6,000 verses grouped 
under 20 books of which the first eighteen form the Atharvaveda proper 
and the last two supplementary additions of comparatively recent date. 

Its borrowings from the Rgveda are considerable, as much as one-seventh 
deriving without variation from the rcas belonging to books X, I and VIII. 
But quite a large number of the verses are original and bear marks of great 
antiquity. At the time of its taking shape, the Vedic Indians had already 
penetrated to the south-east and settled down in the Gangetic plains, as 
evidenced by the mention of a tiger-skin as symbol of royal power.^ Society 
also became differentiated into four castes with the Brahmanas claiming the 
highest privileges. 

The oldest name of this fourth Veda was probably Atharvdhgirasah. 
The frequent separation of this compound word and the mention of the 
Veda by each name show ‘that the compound is not a congealed formula, 
but that the texts are conscious of the fact that each has a distinct indivi- 
duality, a right to separate existence.’^^ Originally, both the words 'athar- 
van' and *ahgiras' meant fire-priest, the fire-cult playing an important role 
in the daily life of the Indian people in much the same way as it did in the 
case of the ancient Persians. The two terms further signified two different 
species of magic formulas; the atharvan referred to holy magic bringing 
about happiness and the ahgiras to hostile sorcery or black magic. 

The Atharvan songs and spells concerning healing of diseases throw 
important light on the oldest system of Indian medical science. Through 
these charms and spells the symptoms of a large number of diseases are 
described with great clarity. Wintemitz notices a remarkable similarity 
between the magic incantations of the Indians and those of old Germans 
in the fact that while the Atharvaveda mentions 55, 77, or 99 diseases, 
German incantations often refer to 77 or 99 diseases.** Another peculiarity 
of the Atharvaveda consists in its recognition of worms as the causes of 
many diseases. Descriptions given of these worms are also of consider- 
able zoological interest. The Atharvaveda is also very rich in anatomical 
nomenclature as will be clear from a glance at Filliozat’s list mentioned 
previously. 

Opinion is divided on the question of origin of the theory of trido^a 
or tridhdtu in the Atharvaveda. But the physiological role of air or prana 
as an organic and cosmic force is well attested in the Sarphitds, including -

the Atharvaveda. This point is important from the point of view of the 
evolution of the pneumatic theory, its maturity in later Ayurvedic texts 
and the parallelism noticed in some Greek texts such as one treatise on this 
subject by Hippocrates and Plato’s Timaeus. 

The Atharvaveda offers little assistance towards our understanding 
of the nature and extent of the Vedic astronomy. Nevertheless, it does 
contain stray passages of astronomical consequence, such as the solar 
eclipse, the mention of rdhu for the first time, intercalation with a thirteenth 
month and similar titbits. Its late nineteenth book reproduces the list of 
28 nak^atras including Abhijit, 

Finally, its cosmogonic and philosophical hymns belonging doubtless 
to the latest parts of this Veda are of no less importance to the history of 
Indian science. In 63 hymns addressed to goddess earth, a specimen of 
good ancient poetry, Mother Earth is described with all her physical geo- 
graphical peculiarities as the supporter and preserver of life. Likewise, 
time (kdla) is recognized as the first cause of all existence. Time is ageless, 
begot the yonder heaven and the earth, then the waters, the brahma, the 
tapas and the regions of space and so on. 


The Brdhmanas 


The Brdhmanas, the second great division of the Vedic hterature, have 
been styled by Winternitz as the ‘Science of Sacrifice’. Eggeling, in his 
introduction to the ^atapatha Brdhmana, has traced the genesis of this 
class of literature to the gradual dispersal of the Brahmana communities 
from the Panjab to the eastern and southern parts of the country and to 
the necessity of dividing sacrificial duties among different classes of priests, 
namely the Hotar, the Udgalar, the Adhvaryu (the performer of the actual 
sacrificial acts) and the Brahmana or high priest. 

The beginnings of such theological elucidations may be seen in the 
Samhitds of the Black Yajurveda where the mantras as a rule are either 
followed by, or intermingled with, their dogmatic explanations to constitute 
the Brdhmana portion which thus developed into a convenient textbook 
for the Adhvaryu priest. This might have stimulated concurrently the 
compilation of Brdhmana texts for the Hotar and the Udgatar priests. The 
Vajasaneyins who came later obviously profited by the experience of the 
older schools and from the beginning separated the Brdhmana from the 
carefully selected mantras and arranged the whole literature in a highly 
systematic manner. The principal Brdhmanas which thus came to be 
attached to the different Sanjhitds are enumerated below:

If the BrdhmanaSy in the course of their theological disputations, sought 
to throw a great deal of light on the earliest metaphysical and linguistic 
speculations and indulged in many mythological fabrications around the 
substance of the hymns and verses of their respective samhitds, they did not 
fail to do so with respect to matters scientific. In this way many astro- 
nomical, anatomical, pathological, physiological ideas and concepts, and 
information regarding plant and animal life assumed clearer perspective 
through Brahmanic interpretations. 

The AranyakaS‘Upani§ads 

The third division of the Vedic literature comprises the Aranyakas 
(forest texts) and the Upanisads (secret doctrines), which arose out of the 
Samhitds and the Brdhmanas of the different Vedic schools. The Aitareya- 
Aranyaka which includes the Aitareya Upanisad is part of the Aitareya 
Brdhmana and likewise the KausUaki Aranyaka-Upani^ad represents the 
concluding portions of the KausUaki Brdhmana. The Pancavimsa Brdhmana 
ends in the Chdndogya Upanisad, of which the first section is an dranyaka. 
The Jaimintya and the Kena Upanisads belong to the Jaiminlya or Talavakara 
schools of the Samaveda. The Upanisads of the Black Yajurveda schools 
include the Taittirlya Aranyaka-Upanisad, a continuation of the Brdhmana 
bearing the same name and the Mahdndrdyana, the Kafha or Kdthaka, the 
§vetdhatara, the Maitrdyanl Upanisads. The greatest and the most import- 
ant of all Upanisads is the Brhaddranyaka which belongs to the Satapatha 
Brdhmana of the White Yajurveda. The Isd Upanisad forming the last 
section of the VdJasaneyJ Satfihitd is short but valuable. The Murufaka 
and the Praina Upanisads are offshoots of the Atharvaveda. 

The six of the above-mentioned Upanisads, viz. the Aitareya, the 
Brhaddranyaka, the Chdndogya, the Taittiriya, the KausUaki and the Kena, 
which, in language and style, resemble the Brdhmanas, represent the earliest 
stage of development of this type of Hterature whose antiquity cannot be 
far different from that of the Brdhmanas.^ The Kafha, the SvetdSvatara, the 
Mahdndrdyana, the Isd, the Mundaka and the Praha which also contain 
the Vedanta doctrine are in all probability pre-Buddhistic. The Maitrdyani 
Upanisad in which the Vedic prose is no longer traceable is of a much 
later date and possibly post-Buddhistic. 

Besides the Upanisads mentioned above, some 200 texts bearing the 
title of this class and attributed to one or the other of the Vedic schools

have come down to us. Most of them having no connection with the 
Veda are akin to the Purdnas and the Tantras and belong to a much later 
date.® Of these several non-Vedic Upani^ads, mention may be made of 
the Subala Upani^ad, frequently referred to by Ramanuja and the Garbha 
Upani^ad; the former deals with metaphysics, cosmology, physiology and 
other matters, whereas the latter, as the title implies, is an embryological 
text having some importance in the history of medicine. 

Written in the form of dialogues often reminding us of Plato, the 
Upani?ads are primarily important as repositories of physical concepts 
concerning both the organic and the inorganic world. A sharp distinction 
is made between these two worlds— a distinction which, in the view of 
Deussen, dominates the Indian view of nature also.*^ Organic bodies such 
as gods, men, animals and plants are in essence the dtman itself and 
are regarded as wandering souls. Inorganic bodies called mahdbhutdni, 
although controlled by Brahman, are not wandering souls, but only the stage, 
the material substratum enabling the souls to play their part. Embed- 
ded in this concept of mahdbhutdni is the idea of five elements whose 
gradual evolution from water as the only primordial element into earth, 
water, fire, wind and ether as the five mahdbhutdni is traceable in the 
Upani?ads. 

The Upanisads tacitly assume that, like the macrocosm, the microcosm 
represented by the human body is also constituted of the five elements. Some 
physiological concepts applicable to man, animals and plants as also some 
elementary principles of classification are met with. Astronomical con- 
ceptions are only slightly developed and do not go beyond what we find in 
the two other preceding divisions of the Veda. In the simple cosmography 
preached by the Upanisads, the earth is surrounded by water and 
has oceans, mountains and seven island continents. The heaven and the 
earth form two halves of the egg of the universe, a recurrent conception 
throughout the Vedic literature. 

Chronology of the Vedic Literature 

The chronology of the Vedic literature has always been, and is even 
now, a matter of great difficulty and controversy. Considering that the 
whole of the Vedic literature must be pre-Buddhist and the Sutra works 
synchronous with the origin and spread of Buddhism, Max MttUer suggested 
the period between 600 and 200 b.c. for the development of the sutras 
the penod between 800 and 600 b.c. for the development of the prose style 
of the Brdhmanas and Aranyakas-Upanisads and the period 1000 to 800 
B.c. for the compilation of the Sarnhitds, of which the poetry part or the 
mantras probably originated in the period between 1200 and 1000 b c ® 
In his views, the o ldest of the Vedas, the ^veda, could not have been

composed earlier than 1200 b.c. Leopold von Schroeder® suggested a 
much earlier date, 1500 or even 2000 b.c., for the J^gyeda, while Hermann 
Jacobi^ and B. G. Tilak,® on astronomical grounds, tried to date the beginning 
of the Vedic literature in the third millennium b.c. The period around 
1400 or 1500 b.c. for the formulation of the earliest ^tgvedic hymns has 
found a strong support from the clay tablets discovered in BoghazkOi, the 
capital of the ancient Hittites who had as their deities some of the common 
V^c gods such as Mitra, Vanina, Indra and Nasatyau.** From an analysis 
of different studies on the Vedic chronology Winternitz concluded, and 
this view is now generally followed, that ‘we shall probably have to date 
the beginning of this development about 2000 or 2500 B.c. and the end of 
it between 750 and 500 b.c.** 


THE VEDANGAS, the SVTRAS AND THE ORIGIN OF 
SANSKRIT SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE 

We now come to another important group of literature, the VedSngas, 
which deal separately with six special branches of knowledge, viz. phonetics 
ritual (kalpa), grammar {yydkarana), etymology {nirukta\ metrics 
{chandafi) and astronomy (jyoii^a)/ These branches of study arose within 
the Vedic schools themselves as a necessary condition for mastering the 
Vedas. Being works of human specialists, these are called Veddngas or 
auxiliary sciences of the Veda. 

The Sutra Style 

Their authors adopted in general the sutra or the highly condensed 
aphoristic style intended to sum up only the pith of the learning in short 
sentences generally using nouns often compounded at great length and 
avoiding the use of verbs as far as possible. The main purpose was to 
facilitate easy memorization of a vast body of ritualistic and other materials. 
From the point of precision and brevity, Winternitz thinks that ‘there is 
probably nothing like these sutras of the Indians in the entire literature of 
the world’.®^ The style became so dominant a feature that this was adopted 
without question by the various philosophical schools, the grammarians, 
phoneticians, specialists on metrics and by the writers of the arthaidstra, 
the kSmaSastrOy the ndtyaidstra and so on. 

On account of great economy of words and the avoidance of verbs, the 
sutras always remained enigmatic except to the initiated. For this reason 
another literary style, the bhS^ya, had to be developed, which aimed at

elucidating the siitras, sometimes in the form of a dialogue between the 
teacher and the student. In this style, often the opposite views are first 
brought in, their insufficiencies explained and the true solutions given at 
the end. The service rendered to the development of this form of writing 
by the great bha^yakdras like Patanjali, Vatsyayana and Sankara, to mention 
a few, need hardly be overestimated. 

If the sutras necessitated the hha^yas, they also no doubt paved the 
way for the development of the §loka form of composition adopted in the 
Dharmasdstrasy medical texts, mathematical and astronomical works, 
encyclopaedic treatises like the Brhatsarrihitd and in arts and sciences in 
general. The main advantage of this form is that it is easy to write and 
memorize and therefore readily appeals to the scholar. One comparatively 
simple meter commonly followed in scientific compositions is the Arydy 
although more complex meters are also used.® After the development of 
these different styles of composition, several authors tended to use one or 
more of them simultaneously in their works, of which the medical samhitds 
are convenient examples. 

Of the various veddftgas mentioned, we may leave aside the phonetics 
largely concerned with the rules of pronunciation, but others contain 
matters of scientific importance. 

The Kalpasutras 

The Kalpasutras are available in four different classes, e.g. the Sraiita, 
the Grhyay the Dharma and the Sulba. As the materials of the Sarphitas 
and the Brdhmanas constitute the basis of these sutraSy passages in them of 
scientific import have received fresh treatment and sometimes further ela- 
boration at the hands of the sutrakdras. Such is particularly the case with 
regard to the Vedic calendars which have received lengthy treatment in 
the Ldtydyana Srautasutra and the Niddnasutra of the Sdmaveda, The 
fourth class of the KalpasutraSy the SulbasutraSy are often attached to the 
Srautasdtras and are important as the oldest Indian works on geometry, 
irrational numbers and other mathematical topics. 

The Mdnava Dharmaidstra or the Manu Smrti and later smrtis 
originated from the Dharmaidstras, one of the four great divisions of the 
Kalpasutras, The mythical Manu is mentioned in the Taittiriya Sarphitd 
and by Yaska; A§vagho§a’s references agree in part with some of the 
teachings of the Manu Smrti; and finally the epic Mahdbhdrata preserves a 
considerable portion of it. Obviously, the form in which we now have it 
developed over a long period of time, and it may be placed anywhere be- 
tween 200 B.c. and a.d. 200.^ As a law book dealing with all aspects of 
human life, it occasionally furnishes information of scientific Value relating 
to botany, zoology, agriculture and the like. This work expressing as it does 
the soul and the philosophy of life of a large section of the ancient Indian

people is comparable to Lucratius’ great poetical work.® Mention may also 
be made of the Ydjnavalkya Smfti (c, a.d. 300) which, although a treatise on 
law, deals at length on embryology and the development of the human 
body.** 

The Yajurvedins were the most active and prolific producers of this 
kind of literature. Among them again the Taittirlya school had an over- 
whelming leadership. Baudhayana, Apastamba and Hirapyake^in of the 
Taittirlya school composed works on all the four departments of the Kalpa- 
sutras, whereas Vadhula, Bharadvaja and Vaikhanasa covered between 
two and three such departments. Similar services on a much reduced 
scale were rendered by Manava and Varaha for the Maitrayani school and 
by Katyayana for the Vajasaneyl school. 

Although it is certain that the sutras were composed after the period 
of the main literary activity in preparing the Sarrihitds, the Brdhmanas and 
the Upanisads was over, that is after 700 or 600 B.C., serious difficulties 
arise as soon as the dating of the sutra literature is attempted. From a 
consideration of the tradition of the Vedic schools as well as from internal 
evidence, Baudhayana and Manava are older than Apastamba, and 
Apastamba must have flourished before Papini, Katyayana and Patanjali. 
Panini’s date is itself debatable and is no better datable than most of the 
ancient texts of this kind. Nevertheless, scholars are generally agreed that 
Papini lived in the fourth century b.c. (c. 350 b.c. according to Keith), 
that Katyayana may be placed around c. 250-200 b.c. and that Patanjali 
who refers to a sacrifice for Pu§yamitra (reigned from c. 185 or 178 b.c.) 
most probably wrote his Mahdbhdsya about 150 b.c.^ On the basis of 
Panini’s date, George Biihler was inclined to place Apastamba 150 to 200 
years earlier, which gives his date as c. 500 to 550 b.c. Keith is not, 
however, prepared to place Apastamba beyond c. 350 b.c.** For 
Baudhayana’s date Keith’s estimate is fifth century b.c. If Biihler’s 
estimate for Apastamba is correct Baudhayana may be dated as c. 600 b.c. 

Grammar y Lexicography and Metrics 

The Prdtiiakhyas which are works on phonetics attached to the different 
Vedas bear testimony to the beginnings of grammatical studies in India. 
Yaska (c. 500 B.c.), the celebrated author of the Nirukta, refers to schools 
of grammarians. Unlike the lexicographers, the grammarians were more 
concerned with the language, both written as well as spoken. Although a 
long line of grammarians must have existed before Papini (c. 350 B.c.), his 
A^tadhydyl possibly rendered obsolete the efforts of his predecessors. 
Written in 4,000 short sutras, the work deals with technical terms, nouns 
in composition and case relations, rules for adding suffixes to the roots and 
so on, always from the point of view of the language and using it correctly 
in composition.

A CX)NaSE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


Katyayana (c. 250-200 b.c.) wrote the V&rttika, an independent work 
in which Papini is often criticized for inaccuracies. Patanjali’s Mahd- 
bha^ya (c. 150 b.c.) is not only a grand commentary on the A^t^dhyayi, 
but contains refutations of Katyayana’s views and additional matters based 
on the works of other grammarians to which no doubt he had access. 
These grammatical works and expositions are a veritable source of informa- 
tion of many scientific and technical subjects as will be seen in the various 
chapters of the book. 

Yaska’s Nirukta is derived from the ancient nighanfavas, that is lexico- 
graphical works containing Vedic terms. Other well-known lexicons 
from which citations have come down to us include Katyayana’s Ndmamala 
and Vyacji’s Utpalini. The most important and exhaustive lexicographic 
work that we now possess is the Namalinganuidscma pf Amarasiipha, 
better known as Amarakoia. Amara was a Buddhist and a poet who 
probably lived in the sixth century a.d.,® although Keith would place him 
after the eighth century.® The scientific importance of the work will be 
apparent from the fact that the first section gives names for sky, celestial 
space (atmosphere, planets and stars), regions, divisions of time, phases of 
the moon, eclipses, denizens of the underworld (serpents, poison). The 
second section deals with terrestrial matters — oceans, fishes, animals, human 
beings, their anatomical peculiarities, diseases, plants and forests, agriculture 
and commerce, geographical information, including stone quarries and 
mines and diverse matters. The third section which contains about 13,000 
terms gives epithets, diflferent names, homonyms, invariant words, in a 
semantic arrangement which served as a model for later lexicographers. It 
is noteworthy that several botanical terms and names of medicinal plants 
further enrich this great lexicon. Renou and FilHozat observe that the 
Agnipurdna is more or less an abridged form of the Amarakoh, 

The Vedic interest in meters is reflected in certain sections of the 
Rk-Prdtiidkhya, Katyayana’s Anukramani, the Niddnasutra and other works. 
But a treatise dealing exclusively with the science of meters as used in the 
Vedic texts is the Chandahsutra of Pingala (c. 200 b.c.) which has come 
down to us with the commentary of Halayudha (the tenth century a.d.). 
Pingala uses algebraic symbols, say / and g, to denote short and long syl- 
lables respectively as well as groups of three syllables to serve as the basis 

of metrical ending, e.g. w = , y = u y The text shows 

acquaintance with about 160 different types of meters. The text is also 
important mathematically as it deals with Pascal’s triangle (meru-prastdra) 
and reveals knowledge of binomial theorem. 

Discussions on meters are also found in the Ndfyaidstra, the AgnU 
purdnOy and the Bfhatsamhitd, Of works on metrics of later periods, mention 
may be made of Jana^raya’s ChandovicitU GangadSsa’s ChemdomaHjari and 
K§emendra’s SuvrttatiJaka (the eleventh century a.d.).

Jyoti?a 

As a Vedanga, the science of astronomy (jyoti^a) is available in the 
recensions of the Rgveda and the Yajurveda, but containing the same 
materials. As an astronomical text, this will receive further treatment in the 
chapter on astronomy. The text is dated c. 400 b.c.,® but the astronomical 
elements taught therein, the positions of the equinoxes that can be deduced 
from clear statements, belong to the period of the Samhitds and the 
Brdhmanas. 


THE PHILOSOPHICAL SOTRAS AND BHA$YAS 

We have seen how the philosophical ideas already embedded in the 
Samhitds and the Brdhmanas were sorted out to initiate a new kind of 
disputation and develop a new type of literature which culminated in the 
Upanisads. During the siitra period, we notice the advent of different 
philosophical schools adhering to definite opinions and giving expressions 
to them in the siitra style of writing. The doctrines summed up in these 
sutras are described by the term darsana which literally means ‘ views ’ or, 
in other words, ‘points of view’, ‘systems’, etc. Several writers have 
enumerated the prevalent philosophical systems differently, but we may here 
distinguish between the orthodox systems of the Brahmanas theoretically 
based more or less on the authority of the Vedas and the unorthodox 
systems represented by the Buddhists and the Jaina schools and by the 
materialistic schools of the Nastikas, the Lokayatas and the Carvakas. 
As the Buddhist and the Jaina schools will be referred to under source 
materials dealing with the Buddhist and the Jaina literature, we shall be 
concerned here largely with the orthodox systems, making a passing 
reference to the literature of the materialists. 

The orthodox systems are traditionally recognized to be six, which 
are paired in three groups on account of certain fundamental affinities and 
agreement between the two members of the pair. These are: the PUrva- 
mimdmsd and the Uttaramlmamsd or the Vedanta; the Sdmkhya and the 
Yoga; and the Nydya and the Vaisesika. Jacobi expressed the view that 
the orthodox systems were in all probability codified between the second 
and the fifth century a.d. during the grand period of spiritual and intellectual 
activity accentuated by the invasions followed by the rise of the Gupta 
power.® He, however, conceded that the Sdmkhyay the Yoga, and the 
Lokdyata might have been developed by 300 b.c. on the evidence of 
Kautilya’s Arthaidstra in which, under the term dnvik^ikl, these three 
systems are clearly mentioned. The Nydya and the Brahmasutra were 
probably composed before the formulation of the Buddhist ViJHdnavdda 
between a.d. 200 and a.d. 450. The PQrvamJmdmsd and the Vaik^ika 


• Renou and Filliozat, p. 178.

28 


A CONaSE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


might have been composed a little earlier. Keith sums up by saying that 
between the dates of the principal Upcmi^ads and the third or the fourth 
century a.d. these different philosophical systems then under active investi- 
gation took their final forms.® Dasgupta disagreed with such late dating 
of the philosophical sutras, as we shall see when we take up the question 
of dates of the individual sutras. 

Renou and Filliozat hold that the origin of the speculation constituting 
the systems is much older than what is implied in Jacobi’s investigations. 
It is quite possible that the activity of the Buddhism, by creating an opposite 
reaction among the Brahmaijas to defend and strengthen their position, 
indirectly contributed to the codification of their philosophies.** The 
speculations of logic possibly developed partly in the medical schools. 

The Mlmamsa 

To start with the MlmdmsS (investigation), the term appears in all the 
Vedic literature since the Yajur- and the Atharva-veda. The word is used 
in the DharmaMstra, Panini knows it and Patanjali in his Mahdbhdsya 
speaks of the MImaipsakas. Katyayana’s Vdrttika on certain points agrees 
with the phraseology of the Mimamsasutra. The original sutras are attri- 
buted to JaiminI about whose personality nothing authoritative is known and 
who in all probability was a mythical personage like the founders of other 
dar§anas. Dasgupta,® however, thinks that the MJmdmsdsutra was probably 
written about 200 b.c. The Mimdnisasiltra was conunented upon by Sabara- 
svamin (fifth century a.d.) and later on by Prabhakara (c. a.d. 600) who 
wrote the Brhati and by Kumarila (c. a.d. 700), the author of the Sloka- 
vdrttika.^ For the history of science, the MImaipsakas hold an important 
position through their interpretation of sound and its propagation, which 
is different from that of the Vai§e§ikas. 

The Sdrrikhya 

The term sdrrikhya which first appears in the Svetdhatara Upani^ad 
literally means that which concerns the number and appropriately so inas- 
much as it frequently resorts to enumeration, categorization and hierarchi- 
cal classification. More generally, however, it also signifies the theory, 
reflection, etc., as opposed to practice implied in the Yoga. The first 
striking fact about the Sdrpkhya doctrines is that these are non-Brahmapic 
in the sense that their bases are not to be found either in the Vedic rituals 
or in their beliefs and teachings. This led to one theory of its origin out- 
side the sphere of the Vedic influence, possibly in the same regions which 
witnessed the beginnings of the Buddhism.^ In fact, the majority of 
scholars — Senart, Jacobi, Garbe, Pischel and, with certain reservations, 

“ Keith (3), p. 472, - Keith (3), pp. 473-74; Renou and FilUozat, p. 10.

Oldenberg— admitted that at a certain point of time the Sdmkhya did form 
the philosophical basis of the Buddhism. Garbe was convinced about the 
influence of the K§atriyas on the development of the system in its primitive 
form, which later on veered to orthodoxy.® Keith and some other scholars, 
on the other hand, believe in the Upani§adic origin of the S&tpkhya, the 
latter’s conception of the three gunas deriving from the former’s three 
elements : water, fire and earth.*’ On the basis of the derivation of Buddhism 
from the Sdifikhya, Wintemitz suggested that the philosophy had been in 
existence since 800-550 b.c.® 

The Sdmkhya ideas in their various forms, primitive or more developed, 
are met with in a variety of literature of which mention may be made of 
the Buddhacarita, the Mahdbhdrata (mok^adharma), the Purdnas (Brahma 
and Vi^nu)y the DharmaMstra, the Caraka Samhitd and in some Tantric 
and Agama literature. Kau^ilya’s reference to Sdmkhya has already been 
mentioned. This itself explains the importance of the system in influencing 
the development of physical concepts about the material world, medicd 
theories and in many other spheres. 

The historicity of Kapila mentioned as the founder of the doctrine or 
of his follower Asuri has not been proved. We are also on uncertain 
ground regarding PancaSikha, another early exponent of the system. The 
first text that we possess on the subject is Sdmkhyakdrikd by Kvarakr§na 
(fourth century a.d. according to Renou and Filliozat and c. a.d. 200 accord- 
ing to Dasgupta).^* Written in Aryd meter, the Kdrikd is a brilliant piece of 
philosophical composition which Barth describes as the pearl among the 
whole scholarly literature of India {le perle de toute la littirature scholastique 
de Vlnde).^ The Kdrikd was commented upon by Gau<Japada (c. sixth century 
A.D.) in his Gau^apddabhdsya also known as Sdrpkhyakdrikdbhdsya, In the 
ninth century a.d., versatile VacaspatimiSra produced a new commentary on 
the Kdrikd, the Sdmkhyatattvakaumudi, which is probably the best work we 
now have on the subject. The Sdrnkhyasdtra also callM the Sdmkhya- 
pravacana, traditionally attributed to Kapila, is a work of a much later 
date (the tenth century a.d.). Aniruddha (c. A.D. 1450) commented on the 
sutra in his Sdmkhyasutravrtti, and about two hundred years later, Vijnana- 
bhik§u (c. A.D. 1650) composed his Sdrpkhyapravacanabhd^ya from the 
curious standpoint of reconciling the Sdmkhya doctrines with those of the 
Vedanta.^ 

The Yoga 

The Yogasutra is attributed to Patafijali who is different from the 
author of the Mahdbhd^a, The sutra makes reference to the Buddhist 
Yogdcdra and may be dated between the third and fifth century a.d. Then 
there is the Yogabhd^ya ascribed to the mythical Vyasa (sixth century a.d.

according to Wintemitz),® on which a commentary was written by 
Vacaspatimisra under the title Tattvavaiiaradi, and by Vijnanabhikju in his 
Yogavarttika. The Yoga system, particularly its offshoot, the Hafhayoga, 
teaches principles and practices calculated to promote a healthy body and 
control and cure many pathological conditions. 


The Nyaya 

The term nyaya variously means ‘method’, ‘rule’, ‘justice’, etc., but 
philosophically it signifies ‘logic’ or ‘reasoning’. Later it developed itself 
into some sort of syllogism in five parts. The Indians have been interested 
in logic from very ancient times, but how ancient it has not been possible 
to say with any certainty. The term anvlk^iki (enquiry), the oldest word 
for philosophy, has also been stretched to mean logic. The founder of 
the Nyaya system is Gotama, sometimes sumamed Aksapada, contempo- 
raneous with Buddha, for which of course no decisive proof exists. But 
Gotama and Ak$apada are two different persons, the latter being credited 
with the redaction of the Nyayasutra about the third century a.d. An 
important point in the development of the Nyayasutra is that similar theories 
of logic appear in the medical text, the Caraka Samhita, which proves the 
existence of the Nyayasutra from the beginning of the Christian era or 
even from pre-Christian times.® 

Of the large number of commentaries available, the earliest and the 
most important is the NySyabhdsya of Pakjilasvamin Vatsyayana who 
flourished in the fourth century a.d. and before the Buddhist logician 
Dignaga. In the beginning of the seventh century a.d., Uddyotakara 
Bharadvaja wrote his Nyayavarttika to explain the sutra and the bha^ya. 
Sorne other important commentaries on the Nyaya system include Vacas- 
patimi§ra’s Nyayavarttikatatparyafika, a commentary on Uddyotakara’s 
above-mentioned work, and the Nyayasucinibandha, an index on the Nyaya, 
Jayanta Bhatta’s (ninth century a.d.) Nyayamafijarl, Udayana’s (tenth 
century a.d.) Nyayavarttikatatparyafikaparisuddhi, the Nyayapariiisfa, a 
mpplOTentary work on logic, and the Nyayakusumdhjali, probably the 
best known of his works. From about the time of Vacaspatimisra a 
tendency developed for syncretizing the doctrines of the two allied schools 
ot Nydya and Vaik?ika, and a large number of Nyaya-Vaikfika works in 
the nature of commentaries began to appear. But before we deal with 
em we ave to say a few words on the origin of the VaiSefika system. 


The VaUe^ika 

In the opinion of some historians of ancient Indian thought, the 
atiefika system of thinking is considered to be very old. Richard Garbe 

• Wmternitz, I, p. 212; Dasgupta places him in a.d. 400

held it to be anterior to Buddhism, possibly inspiring the Jaina philosophical 
thinking and definitely preceding the Nydya. The Vaik§ika is mentioned 
in several Buddhist texts, e.g. the Milindapanha and the Lalitavistdra, and 
the Jaina text the Avassaya,^ The accounts of the VaUe§ika found in these 
texts agree with the sQtras that have come down to us from the first century 
A.D. The Vaik^ika categories are mentioned in the Caraka Sarrihitd. But 
difficulties arise when we try to date the VaUe^ikasUtra, traditionally attri- 
buted to Kanada, but now believed to have resulted from the efforts of 
successive generations of philosophers of the same school. Jacobi’s 
preference for a late dating has already been referred to. Suali preferred 
A.D. 250 to 300, Masson-Oursel a.d. 50 to 150, whereas, in the opinion of 
Renou and Filliozat, the first century a.d. might be the most acceptable 
date for the sutra.^ In the opinion of Dasgupta, ‘these sutras are probably 
the oldest that we have and in all probability are pre-Buddhistic’.*^ 

The oldest work based on the Vai^e§ika teachings, which to all intents 
and purposes is a new and original exposition and not a commentary, is 
the Padarthadharmasarrigraha by Pra^astapMa who flourished in the fifth 
century a.d. So great was the importance and authority of this work that 
the original Vaiksikasutra remained eclipsed for several centuries until it 
found an able commentator in Sankarami^ra, the author of Upaskdra 
(c. 1600). In the meantime, a spate of able commentaries appeared on the 
Paddrthadharmasamgraha, viz. Vyomovatl by Vyoma^ivacarya (c. ninth 
century a.d.), the Nydyakandali by Sridhara (tenth century a.d.), the Kirand- 
vail by Udayana (tenth century a.d.), the Nydyalildvatl by Vallabhacarya 
(twelfth century a.d.) and several others. 

The syncretization of the two schools which, as already mentioned, 
started from about Vacaspatimi^ra’s time is reflected in such works 
as Bhasarvajna’s Nydyasdra (eighth to ninth century a.d.), Sivaditya’s 
Saptapadarthi {c. a.d. 950), Sa^adhara’s Nydyasiddhdntadipa, Gangesa 
Upadhyaya’s Tattvacintdmani (thirteenth century), Raghunatha iSiromani’s 
Padarthatattvanirupana (sixteenth century a.d.), Annam Bhatfa’s Tarka- 
sarrigraha (sixteenth century a.d.) and Vi§vanatha’s Bhd^dpariccheda and 
Nydyamuktdvall (seventeenth century a.d.). 

The rationalism of the Nyaya-Vai§e§ika realists has left its indelible 
marks on the physical concepts of the ancient and medieval Indians, in 
the development of atomism, an impetus theory of motion, nature and 
propagation of sound, classification of plants and animals and their various 
characteristics, and of a methodology by which to acquire true knowledge. 

The NdstikaSy the Lokdyatas and the Cdrvdkas 

The materialistic views of the NSstikas, the Lokayatas and the 
Carvakas have not survived in independent works, but fragments of them 
have been preserved for the posterity in the form of refutations of other

schools fundamentally opposed to them. References to diverse atheistical 
creeds are indeed found in some of the Upani^ads, e.g. the Chandogya 
and the ^vetdhatara. The MahabharatUy the Rdmdyaija, the Mdnava- 
dharmcddstra and the Kdmasutra occasionally mention these views. In 
the Arthddstra, as already pointed out, the Lokdyata is mentioned alongside 
with the Sdrfikhya and the Yoga as one of the three divisions of the dnvik- 
fikl The most complete exposition of the philosophies of these materialists 
is to be found in Madhava’s Sarvadarhnasanigraha (fourteenth century 
A.D.). Jayanta’s NydyamaHjari and Guparatna’s Tarkarahasyadipikd carry 
short notices of them; and for similar brief notices the ^addariana- 
samuccyaya, the Sarvasiddhdntasamgraha and the Lokatattvanirnaya of 
Haribhadra are also of importance.® 

Basically opposed to the Vedas and the orthodox philosophical schools, 
these materialists denied the existence of the soul, considered life and 
consciousness as products of the combination of matter, did not believe 
in after life, reward for action, virtue or vice and placed their sole reliance 
on some sort of Epicurian enjoyment of life. They, however, believed in 
the four elements of earth, water, air and fire, their atomic character and 
the formation of the body as a result of their combinations.* Likewise, we 
know of the Ajivakas led by Makkhali Gosala, a contemporary of Buddha 
and Mahavira, denying the free will of man and the sophistical school of 
Ajitakesakambali, holding the ucchedavada, that is the doctrine of annihi- 
lation of the individual after death. In the present state of our knowledge, 
it is not possible to say whether these unorthodox schools of thought had 
any effect on the progress of science or secular learning. 


THE ARTHASASTRA, THE NiTlSASTRA AND RELATED ARTS 
AND SCIENCES 

By the term the arthasdstra is meant the ‘science of interests’, and as 
such it includes within its purview all doctrines and manuals which concern 
the practical aspects of life, e.g. economics, administration, various arts, 
crafts and techniques, and politics. Nevertheless, the central theme of 
arthasdstra is politics, which is also treated in a number of manuals under 
the title of NitiSdstra, Dantjkmitiy Rdjaniti and so on. 

The origin of the subject may be traced to late Vedic times as is 
evidenced by the use, in the Hira^yakeSi Grhyasutra, of the terms dharma, 
artha and kdma representing the three aims of life. That a separate science 
of arthaSdstra had come into existence as a specialized subject of study is 
attested by the Smrtis of Manu and Yajnavalkya and by the Mahdhhdrata. 
According to the epic, Bfhaspati was the founder of this science of polity 
and might have composed an arthaSdstra, but this cannot be the extant 
Bdrhaspatya-ArthaSdstra which is a modern manual.®

The Arthasdstra of Kaufilya 

The most important text that we now possess is the Arthasdstra of 
Kaufilya also known as Vi§i?ugupta and by the patronymic name of Caijakya. 
A manuscript of the text with a commentary of a small part was first noticed 
by R. Shamasastry in 1905 and pubhshed by him in 1909 in Bibliotheca 
Sanskrita of Mysore. In view of the great importance of the text, a number 
of translations and several scholarly studies appeared in quick succession. 
The work is in prose sQtra-bhdsya style, abounding in obscure technical 
words of uncertain meaning. Occasionally verses and sometimes tri^fubhs 
are used; each chapter ends in a few verses summarizing the main points 
dealt with therein. 

The book is divided into 15 adhikaranas (sections) and 180 prakarartas 
(subjects) with a second subdivision into 150 adhydyas (chapters). The 
length of the text is equivalent to 6, (XX) slokas. From the point of view 
of the history of science, special importance attaches to the second adhi- 
karanOy dealing with the duties of government superintendents. Thus 
there are superintendents who should be able to differentiate between 
superior and inferior gems of which detailed scientific descriptions are 
given (chapter xi). Mining and metallurgical operations involve the super- 
vision of several types of superintendents specialized in mining, metallurgy, 
minting coins, ocean mining, salt manufacture, etc. (chapter xii). The 
chapter xii contains much useful information about chemical practices. 
The chapters xiii and xiv dealing with the duties of the superintendent of 
gold in goldsmiths’ office and state goldsmith contain information on the 
setting of jewels or glass beads in gold, manufacture of beads with round 
orifice, making of gold alloys with varying proportions of copper and silver, 
gold assaying, various methods practised in the adulteration of gold and 
silver and related matters. Characteristics of good and false balances used 
in goldsmiths’ work are described. In chapter xvii, various kinds of trees 
constituting the forest wealth are mentioned, giving some information on 
medicinal plants. A detailed discussion of weights and measures and 
measurement of space and time with astronomical titbits form the subject- 
matter of chapters xix and xx. Chapter xxiv is full of interest from the 
point of view of agricultural practices followed in the time of Kaufilya. 
Cattle-rearing, animal husbandry, detailed information on horses and 
elephants, including their upkeep and uses in war and peace, are described 
in chapters xxix, xxx, xxxi and xxxii. Classification of land, agricultural 
meteorology, public health and sanitation and several matters of scientific 
and techmcal interest also characterize this unique ancient text. By going 
through the book, a modern reader will get the impression that science and 
technology received the fullest possible attention and utilization, through 
the estabhshment of several government departments charged with one or 
many technical subjects, for effectively running the governmental admini- 
stration. Will it be an exaggeration to say that some kind of a science 
policy existed in India during the time of the arthaSdstrasl

A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


Scholarly opinion is divided on the question of the date of Kaufilya’s 
ArthaiSstra. Shamasastry adduced several arguments to prove that 
Kautilya alias Vi§ 9 ugupta alias Capakya, minister of Candragupta, was the 
genuine author of the ArthaMstra, we now have it, which was accordingly 
written between 321 and 300 B.c.® Jacobi, Meyer, Breloer and others 
more or less accepted the authenticity of the work as a compilation of the 
fourth century B.c. Hillebrandt, Jolly, Keith, Bhandarkar, Winternitz and 
others, on the other hand, believe it to be a work of a much later period, 
not much earlier than circa a.d. 300. Some of Keith’s arguments are that 
the historicity of Kautilya has not been proved, Megasthenes makes no 
mention of him, the Arthasdstra makes no mention of the famous wooden 
fortifications of Pataliputra, Patanjali does not know the work, the work 
is posterior to the Smrtis of Manu and Yajnavalkya, but anterior to Kama- 
sutra (fourth century a.d.).^ 

The Nitiidstra and Technical Texts 

It is quite possible to believe that the various sciences noticed in the 
Arthaidstra branched off in the course of time to lead to a spate of literature 
on polity and technical manuals. Kamandaki’s NitUdstra is a minor work 
of polity based more or less on the authority of Kautilya, but differing in the 
treatment of the subject-matter. Although some authorities regard Kaman- 
daki as contemporaneous with Varahamihira (sixth century a.d.), Keith 
places the work in c. a.d. 700 and Jolly in the eighth century a.d.^^ The 
work was translated into old Javanese and circulated at one time in Bali. 
Somadeva’s Nitivdkydmrta emphasizes royal duties more from moral 
aspects than from espionage, cunning and warfare. As we shall see later, 
the Jainas were also interested in the subject and their great author Hema- 
candra produced the Laghu ArhannitL The Sukranitiy attributed to Sukra 
or U^anas, is a much more recent work which deals, among other things, 
with arts and sciences and mentions gunpowder. Bhoja’s Yuktikalpataru 
(eleventh century a.d.) is another interesting work in which we find a good 
treatment of gems and a chapter exclusively devoted to shipbuilding. 

Another curious manual is Mdnasolldsa, also called Abhilasitdrtha- 
cintdmaniy attributed to the Calukya king Somadeva (c. a.d. 1131). The 
work is something like an encyclopaedia treating of education, architecture, 
music, various sciences, and of course the activities of princes and royal 
houses. Its fourteenth chapter entitled matsyavinoda is important from 
the point of view of the zoology of fishes. SrTkumara’s Silparatna (sixteenth 
century a.d.) is largely borrowed from the Mdnasolldsa, 

The architecture {§ilpaidstra or vdstuvidyd) received more comprehensive 
and detailed treatment in a number of works that have come down to us. 
The most comprehensive treatise on the subject is Mdnasdra (the substances

of mensuration) dating from the sixth or seventh century a.d., which has 
something of the spirit of Vitruvius.® Bhojadeva’s Samardnganasutra- 
dhara (eleventh century a.d.) is another architectural work which gives 
besides details of several machines. Some passages give us the impression 
of the existence of an aeronautical science which is probably the result more 
of imaginary thinking than of serious scientific investigations. To this 
class of literature belongs the Yantrasarvasya Yantra, also of the eleventh 
centuiy, which has a chapter on vaimdnika prakaranaJ* 

The third aim of life, the fulfilment of kdma (love), formed the subject 
of serious studies in ancient India, of which the most important text that 
has come down to us is the Kamasutra (aphorisms on love) of Vatsyayana 
Mallanaga of uncertain date. The work is referred to in Kalidasa’s Raghu- 
mmh and Kumarasambhava, Varahamihira’s Brhatsamhitd and by Bhava- 
bhuti, Subandhu, Magha and others. These facts, coupled with archaic 
sutra-bhd^ya style of the Artha^dstra followed in this work, have led 
Winternitz to suggest its date as the fourth century a.d., while Keith 
considers a.d. 500 as reasonable. 


THE EPICS, THE PURAl<fAS, THE POETICS AND THE 
BI^HATSAMHITA 


The Epics 


The Mahdbhdrata, the epic par excellence, is a vast anthology of 1 10,000 
couplets or 220,000 lines in 18 parvans plus a supplementary section on the 
Harivamsa, The Kuruk§etra or the Bharata battle around which the 
whole epic is woven might have taken place between 850 b.c. and 650 b.c. 
although a much earlier date 1400 B.c. has been suggested.'^ According 
to Winternitz, the extant Mahdbkdrata was compiled over a long period of 
time extending from 400 B.c. to a.d. 400.^ 

Statements of scientific importance are scattered in the epic and are 
of a sporadic nature. In astronomy, 12 zodiacal signs, each comprising 
2\ nak?atras, five planets and their motions (grahaedras), are mentioned. 
Information regarding medicine is limited to the functioning of the arteries, 
circulation of blood through nd(^is issuing out from the heart,® and the 
formation of lymph-chyle, blood, flesh, fat, etc.-^ Metals are stated to 
result from heat and earth matter. Gold concentrations in the earth are 
of four types, pipllikd (collected by ants), hiranya (collected from the 
mountains), sdtaktimbha and Jambunada.^ The botanical information 
comprises the recognition of plants as a living organism made up of five 
fundamental principles, and endowed with consciousness;* their ability to 
draw water through the roots and force it up with the help of air pressure;

plant classification, growth and diseases; classification of flower according 
to habitat and colour. In zoology, animals are called trasani (mobile 
creature) and are classified into an^aja, svedaja and Jardyuja which is further 
subdivided into grdmya and dranya,^ Statements regarding animal diseases 
are met with as also the ideas on spontaneous generation of worms and 
insects.*' There are also references to cloud formation due to evaporation 
of water by sun-rays, origin of tide, weaponry, and so on. 

The Rdmdyana, dated between 200 b.c. and a.d. 200, is another epic 
of great popularity, which also gives us some idea as to the state of science 
during the period of its composition and accretion in much the same way 
as does the Mahdbhdrata. Planets, constellations, zodiac and meteors are 
mentioned; information regarding metals, liquors, cosmetics and lapidaries 
is fragmentary; the work abounds in names of trees, herbs, flowers and 
fruits; zoological information regarding animals, reptiles, fishes, insects 
and birds is of no small significance as we shall see in the chapter on 
zoology. 

The Purdnas 

According to Amara’s definition, the Purdnas are distinguished by 
five characteristics (pahcalak^ana), e.g. creation, recreation, genealogies, 
cosmic cycles and account of royal dynasties.^ There are 18 Mahdpurdirias, 
viz. Vi^nu, Mdrkan^eya, Brahmaru^a, Vdyu, Matsya, Bhdgavata, Kurmay 
Bhavi^yay Lihgay Padmay Skanday Brahma Vaivartay Agni, Bfhanndradiyay 
Vdmana, Vardhay Garuda and Brahma, The first, third and fourth conform 
to the five characteristics whereas the rest are not far removed from the 
Smrtis, There are a large number of Upapurdnas, 

As far as sciences are concerned, special importance attaches to the 
Vi^nUy the Markand^yoy the VdyUy XhQ Bhavi§yay the Matsya and the Vi^nu- 
dharmottara (a Upapurdna), The Puraijic cosmology draws upon the con- 
ception of the hiranyagarbhay the pradhanay puru^a and kdla — ideas already 
formulated in the upanisads and other philosophical texts. The Garuda 
Purdna gives an elaborate account of five pathological categories of 
diseases'* and also deals with veterinary science. The Bhavi^ya Purdna is 
important from the point of view of zoology, particularly snakes. The 
Agni Purdna deals with plant science*' and also contains reference to zero. 
In the Bfhanndradiya Purdnay the development of trees through different 
stages are described in some details. The Purdnas have elaborate discussion 
of the four mundane ages, the yugasy some of which were utilized by Brahma- 
gupta and other orthodox astronomers. 

Colebrooke (1), Wilson^ and other scholars dated the Purqnas between 
the ninth and thirteenth century a.d. On the basis of Kaulilya’s reference

to the Purana, Smith thought that this type of literature had already become 
authoritative in the fourth century b.c.® In his voluminous studies on the 
Purdnas, Hazra attempted to fix an approximate date of the Dharmaidstra 
portions of the Purdnas and suggested for the Mdrkarn^eyay the Vdyu, the 
Brahmdnda^ the Vism^ the Matsya and the Bhdgavata a dating ranging from 
the third to seventh century a.d. The Bhavisya may be dated from c, a.d. 
500 onwards, the Agni c. a.d. 800, the Garuda c. a.d. 900, the Brhan- 
ndradlya c. a.d. 800 and the Brahma Vaivarta possibly from c. A.D. 700 
onwards. 

The Poetics 

The development of the brilliant literature on poetics, belles-lettres, 
romantic and historical poetry which frequently indulge in the description 
of nature and its flora and fauna is outside our scope. Nevertheless, 
Kalidasa is of special interest to us, and legend has it that he was one of 
the nine jewels (Dhanvantari, K§apanaka, Amarasiipha, Sanku, Vetala- 
bhatta, Ghatakarpara, Kalidasa, Varahamihira and Vararuci) who adorned 
the court of Vikramaditya. This legend has not, however, been taken 
seriously. It is generally accepted that Kalidasa flourished after A^vagho§a 
and during the ascendancy of the Imperial Guptas, His date, though still 
uncertain, may fall either in the second half of the fourth or in the fifth 
century a.d.^ His Rtusarnhdra, Meghaduta, Kumdra-Sambhavay Raghu^ 
varnsa, Vikramorva§iya, Mdlavikdgnimitra and Abhijhdna ^akmtala are full 
of beautiful descriptions of nature, the seasonal changes, several animals 
and plants and insects. Gupta has extracted entomological information 
of about 18 insects from the great poet’s meticulous observations. 

The Brhatsamhitd 

Varahamihira occupies a special position in the history of science in 
India in view of his wide range of interest and contribution to several fields 
of knowledge. As an astronomer, astrologer and, above all, an encyclo- 
paedic writer, it is difficult to find his peer. His contributions to astronomy 
will be discussed in the chapter on astronomy. His encyclopaedic work, 
the Brhatsarnhitd, for which he is sometimes compared with Pliny, is his 
magnum opus. Through this work, Varahamihira ‘shows himself a master 
of learning of his day in wide fields of knowledge, and thoroughly skilled 
in language and meter, not at times without a real touch of poetic ability*.® 
A critical scholar, scientist and encyclopaedist like al-BIrunI did not fail 
to notice the merit of the book on which he drew heavily in writing his 
own Indica. 

The Brhatsamhitd provides important information on astronomy, 
geography, medicine, chemistry, perfumery, botany, zoology, agriculture,

A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


architecture, psychology, physiology, prosody and several other subjects. 
In astronomy, planetary motions, asterisms, zodiacal divisions, tithis, 
karanas, eclipses, etc., are dealt with. Here we meet with the names of 
several ancient astronomers and astrologers and their works which were 
probably rendered obsolete by his own masterpiece. Other topics dis- 
cussed are erotic remedies, including treatment of plant diseases, clas- 
sification of substances, plant sciences, description of specific characteristics 
of animals. 

With the assistance of Brahmin astronomers of Ujjain, Hunter 
ascertained the date of Varahamihira to be §aka Ally that is a.d. 505.® 
Al-BlrOnT placed him around c. a.d. 526.*> From a study of Amaraja’s 
commentary on Brahmagupta’s Khan^akhadyakay Bhau Daji estimated 
Varahamihira’s death at a.d. 587.® 

BUDDHIST LITERARY SOURCES 

Unlike the Brahmanic literary sources, those of the Buddhists are 
relatively of little importance in view of their philosophy of life centring 
round nirvdndy primary preoccupation with ethical considerations and a 
general lack of interest in positive sciences. Exceptions are, however, in 
the field of medicine, the Buddha himself being acclaimed as the greatest 
of physicians {bhai^ajyaguru)y in certain physical concepts such as atomism 
and the like. ’Amid the many allusions to human activities in the Canon,’ 
writes Keith, ‘we hear of practically nothing scientific, save the pseudo- 
science of astrology and the practical art of medicine, which unquestionably 
deeply coloured the outlook and method of the Buddha as the great healer 
of human evils.’'* Nevertheless, there are enough indications of their 
interest in Brahmanical sciences which they adopted without little or no 
further development and transmitted to other countries along with the 
spread of Buddhism there. In this way we do come across the Podo-min 
literature in China, dealing with Brahmanical astronomy, mathematics and 
pharmacy and the nak^atra list in Uigur manuscripts in Central Asia. 

The Pali Canon 

The Pali Canon represents the teachings of the oldest Buddhist sect 
called Thera (Sanskrit sthavira)y meaning the ‘ancient’, and constitutes, 
according to the TheravSdins (also called the Vibhajyavadins), the most 
ancient and important source for the understanding of Buddhism. The 
Canon is called the Tripifaka, that is ‘three baskets’. Its three diWsions 
and subdivisions are: 

I. The Vinayapifaka, dealing with the discipline of the order, includ- 
mg monastic commu nity, daily life of the monks, orders of discipline, etc. 

• Colebrooke (2). p. xxxiii. • Bhau DaH p 407 

* P- 286. . Keith (5), p. 89. ‘

It is subdivided into (i) the Suttavibhanga consisting of Mahdvibhanga and 
Bhikkunivibhanga; (ii) the Khan4hakds consisting of Mahdvagga and Culla- 
vagga; and (iii) ihQParivdra or Parivdrapdfha. 

II. The Suttapifaka, giving short rules, discourses or sermons often 
in the form of a dialogue. This pitaka comprises five Nikdyas (collections), 
viz. Dighanikdya, Majjhimanikdya, Sarpy^ktanikdya, Angnttaranikdya and 
Khuddakanikdya. 

III. The Abhidhammapifaka, concerned with the higher subtihties of 
the religion and providing the psychological basis of the Buddhist ethics.® 
Its subdivisions are; Dhammasangdni, Vibhanga, Kothdvatihu, Puggala- 
pannattiy Dhdtukathd, Yamaka and Pafthdna. 

Several passages of the Tripitaka further indicate the division of the 
Canon into nine angas, e.g. Sutta (discourses and sermons in prose), Geyya 
(sermons in prose and verse), Veyydkarana (commentaries and explanations), 
Gdthd (stanzas), Uddna (pithy sayings), Itivuttaka (speeches beginning with 
‘Thus has been said’), Jdtaka (stories of former births of the Buddha), 
Abbhuta (miracle stories) and Vedalla (questions and answers). These 
angas are indicative of the fact that some of them were certainly present 
at the time of compilation of the Canon. 

Scientific information of some importance is scattered throughout 
such canonical literature. The Mahdvaggay for instance, has a chapter 
dealing with diseases, their remedies, rules of hygiene, etc. A number of 
medical legends, including the famous legend of Jivaka who used to cure 
diseases by surgery, trepanation and so on, are also found in these canonical 
works. 

According to the tradition, the Tripifakas were compiled at the first 
Council of Buddhists held in Rajagaha (modern Rajgir) shortly after the 
death of the Buddha (c. 485 B.C.). Much reliance is not placed on this 
tradition on the ground that such a voluminous Canon could not have 
been compiled in so short a time. More reliable is the tradition of a second 
Buddhist Council at Vesali about a hundred years after the death of the 
Buddha, when the monks, faced with a great schism, assembled and re- 
hearsed the Vinayapifaka. The Ceylonese tradition has it that in the time of 
Asoka, about 236 years after the death of the Buddha (that is c. 249 b.c.), 
Tissa Moggaliputta convened a third Council of a thousand monks in 
Pataliputra to compile the authoritative Canon of the Theravadins. Then 
there is the vital question of the Pali language of the Tripitaka as we have it 
today and the ancient Magadhi dialect used by the monks of Pataliputra. 
Wintemitz remarks that the Pali Vinaya and the Suttapifaka correspond 
on the whole to the Magadhi Canon of the third century b.c.*' From a 
consideration of all factors, he concludes that a collection of Buddhist 
texts called the PifakaSy divided into NikdyaSy existed before the second 
century b.c., probably as early as the time of A^oka and that this Buddhist

A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


Canon closely resembles the Pali Canon we now have it.» In its present 
form, the Tripifakas have probably been in existence from the early 
centuries of the Christian era. 


The non-Canonical Pali Literature 

Of the extensive non-Canonical Pali literature, mention may be made 
of Milindapahha (Questions of Milinda) written in the dialogue form which 
reminds one of the Upanisads. The work was in all probability composed 
during the first century a.d. The bulk of the non-Canonical Pali literature 
consists of commentaries, that is atthakathds in which Ceylonese monks 
excelled. The Milindapahha was written somewhere in North-West India. 

As to other Indian Pali commentators, we should specially mention 
Buddhagho§a who flourished in the fifth century a.d. Bom of a Brahmin 
family of Magadha and exceedingly well read in the Vedas, he embraced 
Buddhism, spent some time in the Anuradhapur monastery of Ceylon and 
wrote several works and commentaries. His works include the Atthasdlim 
(a commentary on the Dhammasahgdni), the Vi^uddhi-Magga, a systematic 
treatise containing a clear exposition of the Buddhistic doctrine, and a 
number of commentaries on the Vinayapifaka, DIghanikdya, Majjhima- 
nikdya, Ahguttaranikdya and Abhidhammapifaka, 


The Buddhist Sanskrit Literature 

The Pali literature on Buddhism briefly referred to above represents 
by and large the view of the Theravadins. Other schools and sects, parti- 
cularly the Mahayanists, wrote in pure and mixed Sanskrit. This Buddhist 
Sanskrit literature has come down to us in a rather scattered, sporadic and 
fragmentary manner as also in translations in Tibetan and Chinese, which 
are very important for an understanding of this type of literature. A 
large number of these texts have turned up in Central Asia, Kashmir (ruins 
of Gilgit), Nepal and Afghanistan (Bamiyan). A few important ones will 
be noticed here. 

The Divydvadana (divine exploits) is a non-canonical collection con- 
taining at the same time several elements of the Vinayapitaka of the Mula- 
sarvastivadins. It contains elements characteristic of the Buddhist literature 
at the beginning of the Christian era and is important for its references to 
many matters of secular interest, including astronomy.^ The Lalitavistdra 
(narration of the sport) is concerned with the legend of the Buddha up to 
the time of his famous sermon at Banaras and is a work intermediate 
between the Hinayana and the Mahayana texts. The language is Sanskrit 
prose sufficiently regular, but sometimes also mixed, more or less resembling 
another Sanskrit Buddhist text, the Mahdvastu. The work was composed

The Lankavatdrasutra, also called the SaddharmalankdvatdrasQtra, is 
one of the important Mahayana siitras. The work is important from the 
point of view of Buddhist physical concepts, at least of the Mahayana 
school, inasmuch as it teaches the Vijmnavdda, the doctrine of consciousness 
and also a modified view of the siinyavdda. It refutes the philosophies of 
the Sdrnkhya, the Nydya-Vai^esika and the sophists. The text was translated 
into Chinese in a.d. 443 and probably existed between 50 and 100 years 
before that time.*^ The philosophy of Vijndnavdda played an important part 
during the fourth and sixth century a.d. 

The importance of Nagaijuna in the history of Indian science need 
hardly be overestimated. Apart from being the founder of the Madhya- 
mika system of the Mahayana, Nagaijuna, we have it on the authority of 
Kumarajiva (c. a.d. 405), was well versed in astronomy, medicine, produc- 
tion of precious stones and alchemy. Samuel Beal records that he practised 
the art of converting inferior substances into gold and also discovered an 
elixir of life. He was the author of the Mulamddhyamakakdrikd containing 
one of the best accounts of the Mnyavdda and of several other works. 
Nagaijuna’s date is debatable. Keith places him around c. a.d. 200, 
Wintemitz in the latter half of the second century a.d., and, according to 
Renou and Filliozat, he lived towards the end of the first century and the 
first part of the second century a.d. 

The Abhidharmakosa of Vasubandhu who flourished in the fourth 
century a.d. is an important source book on Buddhist atomism. The 
Sanskrit original has long since been lost, but the work has survived in the 
form of a commentary, the Abhidharmakosavydkhyd by Ya^omitra, and 
also in Tibetan and Chinese versions. The work was written from the 
standpoint of the Sarvastivadins and also dealt with the debates between 
the Vaibhasikas and the Sautrantikas — Buddhist schools who believed in 
the atomic constitution of matter. The atomism of these Buddhist schools 
appears to have been borrowed from the Vai§e§ikas. Another Buddhist 
work of uncertain date, but translated into Chinese, is Abhidharmahrdaya 
in which a much fuller treatment of the atomic theory is met with. The 
earlier and classical Yogacarins appear to have accepted the theory pro- 
visionally, but the later ones led by Dignaga (fifth century a.d.), the famous 
logician, found no use of it in their system of logic, in which, in consequence, 
the theory was refuted. Nevertheless Dignaga’s Pramdnasamuccaya, Hetu- 
cakranirriaya, Nydyamukha, Nydyapraveia and other works throw important 
light on the subject. Considerable importance also attaches to the works 
Nydyavindu and Sambandhaparlksd by Dharmakirti (seventh century a.d.), 
the celebrated successor in the Dignaga school of logic.

JAINA LITERARY SOURCES 

Unlike Buddhism which developed into a world religion, Jainism 
remained confined within the geographical boundaries of India. Jainism 
also showed stronger affim'ties to Brahmanism in many respects. One 
result of this has been that the Jainas like the Brahmanas, exhibited con- 
siderable interest in secular learning and sciences and made notable contri- 
butions to philosophy, grammar, lexicography, science of politics, astro- 
nomy, mathematics, medicine and other technical matters considered 
important in their times. This interest is reflected in their oldest canonical 
literature as well as in the production of a large number of technical liter- 
ature. The Jainas have a special claim in the development of many of the 
Indian languages such as Tamil, Telugu and Kannada in the south and 
Gujarati, Hindi and Marvari in the north.® 


The Canonical Literature 


The Jainas call their sacred literature the Siddhanta or Agama and 
believe them to be very ancient. This literature propounds the Jaina 
doctrine in a discursive manner, and contains rituals, biographies of ancient 
religious preceptors, the direct teachings (pravacana) of Mahavira and also 
profane matters. The number of their canonical texts is stated to be 45 
or 50; if some subsidiary elements are taken into account, this number may 
go up to 84 plus 36 Nigamas or Upani?ads. The principal texts are the 

Angas, the Upmgas, the Praldrnakas, the Cheda-sutras and the Mula- 
siitras. 


The Angas are twelve in number and generally deal with doctrinal 
matter, ntuals, legends, ethics and so on. These are: the Acaranga the 
Suyagadanga, the SthanSnga, the Samavay^ga, the Bhagavati or Vyakhya- 
prajUyU, the Nayadhammakahao, the Upasakadaia, the Antakrtadasa, the 
Amuara-aupapatikadasa, the Prama-ryakarana, the Vipakasutra and the 
Drnivada. The Sthananga and the Bhagavatisutras, in particular, contain 

various 

Aupapauka, iht Rajaprainiya, the JiyajJvabhigama, the Prajnapana the 

the jormof^ geography and ethnography. The slrya- and

Candra-prajHapti mean information on the sun and the moon, and are as 
such astronomical texts which more or less follow some of the precepts 
and principles found in the Vedanga Jyoti^a, There are also important 
differences in the fact that these texts advocate the theory of two suns, two 
moons and two series of naksatras in keeping with their peculiar cosmo- 
graphical ideas. The sixth Up&nga, the Jambudvipa-praJHapti, deals with the 
Jaina views of cosmography comparable in many respects with those of the 
PuranasJ^ 

The Praktrnakas, meaning ‘dispersed texts’, are 10 in number and may 
be likened to the Vedic ParWsfas, We may specially refer to the Tarpdula- 
Veydliya which, in the form of a dialogue, discusses among others, matters 
relating to physiology, anatomy, embryology, measurement of length and 
time. 

The six Chedasutras mainly deal with rituals and have much in common 
with the Buddhist Vinayapifaka, One of them is the Da§a§rutaskandha 
containing a Kalpasutra ascribed to Bhadravahu, who died 170 years after 
MahavTra’s nirvana (468 or 467 

There are four Mulasutras, viz. the Uttarddhydyana, the Avasyaka, the 
Daiavaikdlika and the Pinda-NiryuktL The first one often compared with 
the Suttanipdta of the Buddhists has great literary merit and contains 
occasional passages of importance to mathematics. 

Finally, we have two individual texts, the Ndndlsutra and the Anuyoga- 
dvdrasutra, sometimes included in the Prakfrnakas, Their importance 
lies in the fact that they deal not only with religious matters but also with 
secular subjects such as mathematics, grammar, philosophy, polity, kdma- 
sutra, drama and the Vedas and refer to standard Brahmanic texts dealing 
with the Artha§dstra, VaUesika system, Lokdyata philosophy and Vatsa- 
yana’s Kdmasutra,^ 


Chronology of the Jaina Canon 

The problem of determining the chronology of the different parts of 
the Canon has been rendered difficult by considerable interpolations and 
intermixing of fairly recent elements with those of the old. The tradition 
itself attributes certain portions of the Canon to authors of more or less 
later dates. At the same time, it is possible to believe that the main core 
of the teachings must have existed at the time of Vardhamana Mahavlra. 
However, by a process of counting how many times the same themes have 
been repeated in the various Ahgas, Updngas, Prakirnakas and so on, the 
numerical series, the citations and diverse interrelationships, Jacobi and 
Schubring concluded that the most ancient portions of the Canon took 
their shape during the third and fourth century b.c.^* From linguistic 
considerations, the language of the Canon is ardhamdgadhi containing

several foreign elements of later date and is clearly different from the dialect 
which Mahavira must have used. 

Philosophical, Scientific and Technical Literature 

As has already been remarked at the beginning, the Jainas have been 
credited with a voluminous production of philosophical, scientific and 
technical literature. One of their earliest philosophers is Kundakunda of 
the Digambara sect, who flourished during the first century a.d. and wrote 
the Pravacanasara in aphoristic style to expound the Jaina epistemology 
and the theories of tattva and astikdya. 

UmSsvamin, also known as Umasvati, was a pupil of Kundakunda 
and probably lived in the first centuries of the Christian era. His Tattvdrthd- 
dhii^amasutra in which an attempt was made to explain the true nature 
of things is acknowledged as an authoritative text by both the Digambaras 
and the Svetambaras. Written in Sanskrit, the work is divided into six 
sections dealing with true faith, the soul, the universe, the substances and 
karman, and the deliverance. Besides dealing with logic, psychology, 
cosmography, ontology and ethics, this is the most authoritative text for 
Jaina atomism, classification of animals and several matters of scientific 
interest. The work was commented upon by Siddhasena Divakara 
(seventh century a.d.), Samantabhadra (eighth century a.d.), Akalanka 
(ninth century a.d.) and a number of other prominent Jaina teachers. This 
was a period of great ferment in philosophical disputations in which 
the Jaina and Buddhist logicians had to defend their systems against 
the onslaughts of the MTmaipsakas and representatives of Brahminical 
orthodoxy. 

Haribhadra was another great Jaina philosopher and encyclopaedic 
wnter (eighth century a.d.) deeply versed in all philosophical systems. In 
his Saddarianasamuccaya, he discussed the philosophical positions of 
Buddhism, the Sdmkhya, the Nydya-Vaisedka, the philosophy of JaiminI 
and Carvaka’s materialism. His interest in Dignaga’s logic is reflected 
in his effort to write an unbiased commentary Nydyapraveia.^ This work 
was commented upon by Gunaratna (fourteenth century a.d.), an able 
Jaina philosopher and commentator, in his Tarkarahasyadlpikd} Hema- 
candra (twelfth century a.d.) rendered signal service to the development 
of the science of grammar through his grammatical masterpiece, the 
Slddhahemacandra (siitra and vrtti), a well-arranged work of great clarity.® 
This work, however, was based on Jainendra Vydkarana (c. a.d. 678) as- 
cribed to Jinendra, but really composed by Devanandin.** To Hemacandra 
is attributed a work on NItLidstra (Laghu Arhanniti) of which the materials 
were in all probability taken from a prakrt work no longer extant.

and mythology. The Jaina canonical and non-canonical texts frequently 
give the impression, like those of the Buddhists, of their acquaintance 
with, and interest in, medicine. One Jaina medical text under the title of 
Kalyanakdraka is known, but its date is uncertain.'* The work is based on 
Ayurvedic texts with the difference that remedies and prescriptions intended 
for human beings are extended to the animals in conformity with the Jaina 
concern for life in general. Regarding astronomy, mathematics and cosmo- 
graphy, the Jainas composed special Updngas already referred to and pro- 
duced a great mathematician in the person of Mahavira who lived around 
A.D. 850. 


PERSIAN AND ARABIC SOURCES 

The contact between India and Persia and West Asia is very ancient, 
of which we have evidence from the protohistoric period and particularly 
from the time of the Achaemenian power in the historic period. In fact, 
in the time of Darius, the Indus basin formed one of the satrapies of his 
extensive empire. In these circumstances Indian science and literature 
found their way into Iran and West Asia at a fairly early date and several 
typically Indian ideas and concepts appeared in the early literature of the 
area. This was also reciprocated. 

The Persian language, that is Fdrsi, the language of Ears, one of the 
provinces of Persia, is ‘the lineal offspring of the language which Cyrus 
and Darius spoke, and in which the proclamations engraved by their 
commands on the rocks of Behistun . . . and Naqsh-i-Rustam, and the 
walls and columns of Persepolis, are drawn up’.*' Although this ancient 
language of the Indo-Iranian group has suffered many vicissitudes and its 
continuity was broken by invasions by the Greeks and by the Arabs, its 
identity was never lost, being inescapably modified by the culture of the 
conquerors. 

Another important characteristic of the language is the change of the 
script from the cuneiform to the Pahlavl and later on from Pahlavl to 
Arabic. Browne has divided the history of the Persian language into 
three periods,® e.g. (1) the Old Persian of the Achaemenian period (550- 
330 B.c.) written in cuneiform character, of which only inscriptions are 
available; (2) the Middle Persian of the Sassanian period (a.d. 226-652), 
written in the Pahlavl script, for which it is generally known as Pahlavi 
and of which the Zoroastrian theological and liturgical materials constitute 
the bulk of the literature; and (3) the Modern Persian of the Muhammadan 
period (from about a.d. 900 to the present day) when the Pahlavl of the 
Sassanian period adopted the Arabic alphabet with the addition of four 
letters for phonetic reasons.

46 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


The effect of Hellenism, as N6ldeke observed, was skin deep. The 
Pahlavl profoundly influenced the language by producing a large body of 
theological as well as secular literature covering sciences, particularly during 
the reign of NQshIrwan, the Just, the greatest Sassanian king (a.d. 531- 
579). But Islam and the cultural content represented by it penetrated into 
the very core of the Persian language. India produced an extensive liter- 
ature in modern Persian which, growing as it did chiefly under the influence 
of Hindi and local Prakfts, was different from the Persian Persian.® 

From the point of view of history of science in India, the ancient 
scriptures of the Zoroastrians, the Zend-Avesta and their later recensions or 
recastings in the Sassanian period are of particular interest. According 
to Geldner, the GdtMs of the Avesta are the actual utterances of Zoroaster 
probably dating from 1000 b.c. or even 1400 b.c.*> Darmesteter has, 
however, shown that the Avesta of the Achaemenian times perished after 
Alexander’s invasion, that it was reconstructed during the first century a.d. 
in the reign of the Parthian Vologeses I (a.d. 51-78) and this process contin- 
ued till the Sassanian times when it absorbed many elements of Neo- 
Platonism and Gnosticism. Moreover, Media was the home of the Zoroas- 
trian doctrine, the old Perso-Medic language was probably its medium, 
and the earliest literature probably did not go beyond the sixth or seventh 
century h.c.^ The Avesta, as it existed in the Sassanian period, consisted 
of 21 nosks, of which only one, the Vendidad, is now known to us. Portions 
of at least four others form the text of the Yasna, Vispered, a book of 
formulas and doxologies, is supplementary to Yasna, The contents of the 
remaining nosks are known to us in summary form from the important 
Pahlavl work, the Dinkard, dating from the ninth century a.d. Some of 
the scriptural hymns now form the text of the Yashts, And finally, we 
possess the Khorda Avesta (the Little Avesta) compiled for the laity in the 
reign of Shapur II (a.d. 310-379). The Sassanian Avesta contained about 
347,000 words of which only some 83,000 or one-fourth have survived.** 
Filliozat has shown many parallelisms between the medical, physio- 
logical and pathological doctrines of the Ayurveda and those of the Avesta 
in its surviving texts represented by the Vendidad, the Yasna, the Yashts 
and others, although differences are also many.* In astronomy, similar 
parallelism and differences are known. That such exchanges of ideas 
took place are attested by the development of Jundishapur, under Nushirwan, 
as a leading centre of Persian medicine, in which Indian Ayurvedic system 
was syncretized with the Greek system propagated there by the Nestorian 
Christians. Burzuya, physician to Nushirwan, was actually sent to India 
to bring back Indian works on medicine, the Pancatantra (the Book of 
Fables) and the game of chess. The medical works and the Book of Fables

were translated from Sanskrit into Pahlavi. The Jundishapur school of 
medicine continued its active existence and, after the Arab conquest of 
Persia, exerted a great influence on the development of Arabian medicine.® 

During the Caliphate, when vigorous centres of learning sprang up in 
the newly founded cities of Baghdad, Basra and Kufa, and streams of 
learning began to pour in from Persia, India and the Byzantine Empire, 
the Sassano-Persian language still played the dominant role, particularly as 
a court language and as the language of belles-lettres and poetry. ‘ The 
Persians’, writes Sarton, ‘ introduced into the Caliphate a greater love of 
beauty, urbanity, intellectual curiosity, and much fondness for discussion. 
These conditions were favourable for the progress of science And 

so it was no accident that the early architects of science through the Arabic 
medium were either Persians or Jews or Christians. Thus Ibrahim al- 
Fazail, Ya‘qub ibn Tariq, al-Naubakht, Ibn al-Muqaffa were Persians, 
Mashallah was an Egyptian Jew, and the Bakhtyashu’ family who did 
much to develop medicine were Nestorian Christians. Interest in the 
development of the Persian language never languished even after Arabic 
became the international language of science. In the tenth century a.d., 
Abu Man§ur Muwaffaq ibn ‘All al-HarawI of Herat, a Persian pharmaco- 
logist, wrote his KitabU-Abniya ^an HaqdUq*l-Adwiya {Book of the Found- 
ations of the True Properties of the Remedies), Believed to be the oldest 
prose work in modem Persian,® the book utilized materials from Greek, 
Syriac and Indian medical sources. In the second half of the eleventh 
century a.d., al-Hasan ibn al-§abbab, Omar Khayyam, mathematician and 
poet, Na§ir-i-Khusraw, poet and geographer, Zarrin Dast, ophthalmologist, 
and Asadi, lexicographer, all wrote in Persian. As a language of literature 
and poetry, if not of the sciences, Persian reached its highest watermark 
in FirdawsT. 

The Qur'an introduced a new and vigorous language, Arabic, which 
was destined to become the international language of knowledge and cul- 
ture and of sciences, in particular, for several centuries. The work was 
edited twice by Zaid ibn Thabit (d, a.d. 673-74), and his final edition 
has remained the standard version ever since.^* Arabic, like Voltaire’s 
French, is a dry, precise and practical language eminently suitable for the 
exact sciences. Its great advantage lies in its facility, like Sanskrit, to lend 
itself to the easy coining of technical terms. 

It was again left to the Persian 61ite, as remarked before, to appreciate 
the power and merit of the new language. The first Arabic grammar, for 
example, was composed not surprisingly by Abu-l-Aswad (d, c, a.d. 688), 
a Persian of Basra. Basra and the rival city of Kufa in Iraq also witnessed 
the rise of early grammatical schools for the simple reason that the mixed 
population of these cities, after the Arab conquest, needed this key and 
instrument for the mastery of Arabic much more than the Bedouins who

spoke it as their mother tongue, la this case the parallel with the Greek 
grammar is very close, for the latter also arose not among the Athenians 
but among the mixed Alexandrians for whom it was a practical necessity.'* 

When the grammatical and philological foundation of the Arabic 
language was thus being laid, simultaneous efforts on a much more extensive 
scale were made to enrich the literature by absorbing the materials from 
foreign sources, notably Persian, Indian and Greek. Ibn al-Muqaffa 
translated Pahlavi works on logic and medicine and also the Kallla-wa- 
DimnUy originally transmitted to Persia from India. An Arabic translation 
from a Persian version of the Car aka Saijihitd was also probably made 
during this early phase, as we have it from the Fihrist} Another early 
Pahlavi book, the Zik-i Shatro-aydry an astronomical work based on Indian 
elements, was translated into Arabic by al-TamimI under the Arabic title 
Zij-ashshahrlydr. 

During the reign of the second Abbasid Caliph al-MansQr (753-774), 
Sanskrit scientific works were directly available for either translations or use 
in composing scientific texts in Arabic. In astronomy and mathematics, 
as we shall see later on in chapters on these subjects, Ibrahim al-Fazari 
(d. 796 or a.d. 806), Ya‘qub ibn T^riq, al»Khwarizmi (d, c. a.d. 850), al- 
Kindi (J. c. a.d. 873), Habash al-Ha§ib (d, c. a.d. 864 or 874) and a few 
others translated Sanskrit works into Arabic and/or wrote independent 
works explaining the Indian system and methods of calculations. In this 
effort, Indian astronomers and physicians engaged in Baghdad played no 
small part either as interpreters of Sanskrit texts or as translators into 
Arabic itself, which they must have mastered for this task. 

Many of these early Arabic translations of, or works on, Indian scienti- 
fic texts were lost, and a few have been preserved in Latin translations. 
But of works no longer extant, our main source of information is the 
fihrist or ‘index’ of Abu’l-Faraj Muhammad b, Ishaq al-Warraq of Bagh- 
dad, better known as ibn Abi Ya‘qub an-Nadim, composed in a.d. 988. 
One of the most valuable and remarkable encyclopaedic works in Arabic 
(edited by Flugel), the Fihrist records ancient works and views on philo- 
sophy and science in its seventh discourse, in three sections, as follows: 
(1) account of materialist philosophers and logicians; (2) account 
of mathematicians, arithmeticians, geometricians, astronomers, scientific 
instruments makers, mechanics and engineers, musicians and accountants; 
and (3) account of medicine, its origin, names of physicians and medical 
texts, ancient and modern. The ninth discourse deals, among others, with 
Indian sects, and the tenth discourse is devoted to alchemy.® 

As far as Indie studies among the Arabic and Persian scholars are 
concerned, nobody surpassed Abu Railjian Muhammad ibn Aljmad al- 
Biruni (973-1048), a Persian by birth and a Shi'ite. During the period 
between a.d. 1017 and 1030 when he was travelling, as a political hostage,

with Mahmud of Ghazna in the course of the latter’s Indian campaigns* 
al-Biruni spent a good part of it in different parts of north-western India* 
studied Sanskrit, went over the original Sanskrit manuscripts to check up 
earlier Arabic writings on India and approached the whole subject with a 
critical mind and a scientific detachment rare in those days. His well- 
known works are the Kitdb al-dthdr aUbdqiya ^ani-l-qurun aUkhdliya (Chrono- 
logy of Ancient Nations), discussing the calendars and eras of various 
peoples, including the Indians, the Ta^rikh aUHind (Account of India), 
dealing, among others, with Indian sciences, particularly astronomy in great 
detail, the al-Qdmn aUMas'udi (an astronomical encyclopaedia) and the 
al-Tafhlm li-awdUl Sind'at al-tanjim (a summary of mathematics, astronomy 
and astrology). Sachau tells us that he composed about 20 books on 
India, both translations and original works, and also a number of legends 
and tales based on folklores of ancient Persia and India.® Besides his 
professional interest in Indian astronomy, mathematics and geography, 
already roused by the works of his predecessors like al-KhwarizmI, al-Kindi 
and Abu-Ma‘shar of Balkh, he developed a great deal of interest and fondness 
for Indian philosophical literature, particularly the Sdmkhya, the Yoga 
and the Bhdgavatgitd. He was possibly the first foreign scholar to have 
seriously studied the Purdnas, specially the Visnudharma, the Vism, the 
Matsya, the Vdyu and the Aditya, as he incorporated several extracts from 
them in his Ta'rikh aUHind. It is needless to emphasize the importance of 
al-Blruni’s works as a source of inestimable value for the study of the 
history of science in India. 

It has already been mentioned that India produced an extensive liter- 
ature in Persian. In Iran, the language was enriched by the assimilation 
of Turkish, Arabic, French and Russian words, phrases and idioms; in 
India, a similar process went on in which the vitality of the language once 
again manifested itself in the absorption of many Hindi and Prakrt words 
and idioms. The Turks who established their powers in India and intro- 
duced Persian in Hindustan usually spoke Turki and did not have Persian 
as their native tongue, although many of them could speak the language 
fluently. The Princes of the House of Timur and Babur, the founder of 
the Mughal Empire, had a great love for Persian and adopted it as their 
own literary tongue.*’ Babur, of course, wrote his autobiography in Turki, 
but he was sufficiently accomplished in Persian to be able to compose 
poetry in it. Even in the course of his brief acquaintance of India, he 
came under the influence of Indian languages and used hundreds of Hindi 
and Urdu words in his Memoirs. Ibn Batuta who wrote in chaste Arabic 
could not avoid the use of Indian words in his travel account. 

Of the Persian literature produced in India, the Scientific and technical 
one represented no small part, as the bibliographical studies undertaken 
by the Medieval Period Unit of the History of Science study group of the 
National Institute of Sciences of India (now renamed Indian National

Science Academy) indicate. These vast materials are yet to be studied 
and analyzed, and when this is done we expect to be in a better position to 
assess the contribution of Medieval India to the development of science 
and technology as far as concerns Persian and Arabic. The same is also 
true of other medieval apabhratfi^a languages, the scientific contents of 
which have so far received scant attention. 

Nevertheless, of the editions, translations and studies of some of the 
works already made, Aba’l-Fazl’s (1551-1602) deserves special 

consideration. This Imperial Gazetteer of Akbar’s time is full of interest 
from the point of view of science and technology. Here we find not only 
an account of Indian and Arabic astronomy, but also a long list of lat- 
titudes and longitudes of places in India, compiled from the works of 
al-Blruni, the Maragha school of astronomers and other sources. The AHn 
is an important source book for botany and agriculture in Medieval India. 
In zoology, it has long chapters on elephants, horses, camels and other 
animals. In metallurgy, particularly centring round coinage, we have 
valuable information regarding the determination of the purity of gold 
and silver in coins, processes of refining and casting these metals, pre- 
paration of alloys like brass and their use in making various objects. In 
pyrotechnics and in the technology involved in the manufacture of guns and 
canons, their upkeep, cleaning of gun-barrels, etc., the AHn records details 
of inestimable value and mentions, among a number of scientists, Fathullah 
Shirazi, a versatile genius.® 

The Memoirs of Jahangir, the Tuzuk-i-Jahangirly is another important 
source for medieval zoology and horticulture, although matters of scientific 
interest relating to diseases like plague, hydrophoebia due to mad dog- 
bite, eclipse, comet and meteorites are occasionally mentioned.^

and the Candraprajnapti. During the first few centuries when astronomy 
in India was undergoing important and radical changes and assuming the 
character of an exact science through the use of the mathematical apparatus, 
a number of siddhdntas appeared, of which only a few survived because of 
their better accuracy in the reckoning of time. In Var^amihira’s Pafica^ 
siddhdntikd (c. a.d. 505), we have the summary of the principal astronomical 
elements of five siddhdntas, e.g. the Paitdmaha, the Vaii?tha, the Pauliia, 
the Romaka znd the Saura (also called the Surya), The last named sid- 
dhdnta described by Varahamihira as the most accurate had a career of

continuous development in the course of which it absorbed new concepts 
and methods from later astronomers like Aryabhata I, Bhaskara I, Brahma- 
gupta, Manjulacarya and others. 

Because of the mathematization, the early siddhantas are important 
source materials for both astronomy and mathematics. In fact, most of 
them have separate chapters or sections giving rules for solutions of various 
types of problems in arithmetic, algebra, geometry and trigonometry in 
order that astronomical rules and formulae can be understood without 
difficulty. In this class we have Aryabhata Fs (b. a.d. 476) the Arya- 
bhafiya; Bhaskara Fs (c. a.d. 600) the Mahabhaskarlya, the Laghubhaskariya 
and a commentary on the Aryabhaflya; Brahmagupta’s (c. a.d. 598) the 
Brahmasphuta-siddhanta and the Khandakhadyaka; Vate§vara’s {b, a.d. 
880) the Va(esvarasiddhdnta\ Manjulacarya’s (c. a.d. 932) the Laghumdnasa; 
Aryabhata IFs (c. a.d. 950) the Mahasiddhanta; Sripati’s (c. a.d. 999) the 
Dhikoti and the Siddhdntatilaka; ^atananda’s (c. eleventh century a.d.) the 
BhdsvatJi ^nd Bhaskara IFs {b. a.d. 1114) the Siddhdnta~§iromani divided 
into four parts, viz. the Lildvatl (on arithmetic), the Bijaganita (on algebra), 
the Gariitddhydya and the Golddhydya (the last two on astronomy). 

As to texts dealing exclusively with mathematics in this period, mention 
may be made of the Bakhshall Manuscript (c. third or fourth century a.d.); 
Mahaviracarya’s (c. a.d. 850) the Ganitasdra-sa/pgrahat representing a final 
synthesis of Jaina mathematics and drawing freely upon previous or con- 
temporaneous Brahminical texts; Sridharacarya’s (c. a.d. 991) the Paff- 
ganita and the TrUatikd; Srlpati’s the Ganitatilaka; and Narayana’s 
(c. A.D. 1350) the Ganita-kaumudi and the Bijaganitdvatamia, 

There are several commentaries on the above-mentioned astronomical 
and mathematical works which appeared mostly during the medieval 
period, say, from after the time of Bhaskara II (there are notable exceptions 
such as works of Bhaskara I, Prthudakasvami (c. a.d. 864), GovindasvamI 
(c. A.D. 800-850) and a few others). The contributions made by these com- 
mentators will be discussed in chapters on astronomy and mathematics. 
Some of them like Parame^vara (c. end of fourteenth and early fifteenth 
century a.d.), Nilakapfha Somasutvan (1465-1545), and some members of 
Divakara and Vallala families showed originality and wrote independent 
works. 

During the medieval period, a large number of important mathematical 
and astronomical texts in Arabic and Persian originating in the Arab world 
of scholarship were in circulation among the intellectual groups in Tnriia

We also know of a number of able commentators who produced 
explanatory treatises, translations, etc., on mathematics. Some of them are 
Golkonda’s Abu ls(iaq b. ‘Abdu’Uah (c. 1555), Abu‘l-Faiz FaizI (cad 
1587), ‘Atau’llah Rashidl (c. 1634), Mir M. Hashim b. Qasim al-yusaim'i 
MedhnI Mai (e. 1663), Ismatu’Uah as-Saharanpuri (c. 1684) and Lutfu’llah 
Muhandis (c. seventeenth century a.d.), whose works will be noticed in the 
section on mathematics. 

No less important are the efforts of men like Mahendra Suit (c four- 
teenth century), Kamalakara (c. a.d. 1616), Nllakaptha Jyotirvid, Samrat 
Jagannatha (b. a.d. 1652), Nayanaiukhopadhyaya (c. a.d. 1730) and others 
sorne of whom translated Arabic and Persian texts on astronomy and 
mathematics and some incorporated new prineiples and methods found in 
ese texts m their Sanskrit works based largely on traditional Brahmanic 
methods. In an earUer age al-Adami, al-Fazari, Ya’qub ibn Jariq, al- 
Khwarizim and several others working outside India and al-BirunI spend- 
mg some time m India rendered this signal service of syncretizing India’s 
contributions with the new rising astronomical-mathematical learning

Caraka SamhM was again revised by Dfdhabala, a Kashmirian physician, 
who flourished either in the eighth or ninth century a.d. Caraka’s date 
has been much discussed, and there is general agreement in placing him 
in c. A.D. 100. 

Su§ruta belonged to another parallel school, that of Divodasa-Dhan- 
vantari, one Bharadvajadhanvantari being mentioned in the Sdnkhdyana- 
grhyasutra.^ It is doubtful if Su^ruta is a historical personage as the Samhitd 
going by his name appears to be the work of a school and to have under- 
gone several revisions even before the emergence of the extant text in the 
redaction of Nagaijuna. Is this Nagarjuna, the redactor of the Suiruta 
Samhitd^ the same as the founder of the Madhyamika system of the Maha- 
yana Buddhism or the author of the Yogohtaka (c. fourth century a.d.) or 
the alchemist bearing the same name (ninth century a.d.), mentioned by 
al-Biruni? The identification of several such Nagarjunas is still an open 
question. The commonly accepted date of this finally redacted text is 
between third and fourth century a.d., and the original Suiruta Samhitd 
probably existed several centuries earlier, say, during the last few centuries 
before the Christian era. 

Archaeological explorations carried out in Central Asia yielded from 
Kashgar the important medical text, the Bower Manuscript, also called the 
Ndvanltaka. Written in a kind of barbarous Sanskrit heavily mixed with 
Prakrt words, the text follows the teachings and prescriptions of ancient 
medical samhitds and cites as its authorities Atreya, K§arapani, Jatukarna, 
Para^ara, Harita, Bhela and Suiruta. On palaeographic ground, Hoeml6 (4) 
dated the Bower MS. to between a.d. 350 and 375. Another manuscript 
(a few pages only) discovered from the region of Kucha in Central Asia is 
the Yogo^ataka belonging to the seventh century a.d. (possibly a copy of 
the similar text attributed to Nagarjuna, dated three centuries earlier) and 
at one time popular in Tibet, Nepal and some parts of India. This Yoga- 
§ataka, in the opinion of Filliozat, responds closely to the eight-limbed 
medical treatise mentioned by I-tsing.** 

Other important medical works of later dates include the elder Bag- 
bhata’s Astdhgasamgraha and the younger Bagbhata’s Astdhgahrdaya- 
sanigraha (between seventh and eighth century a.d.), Madbavakara’s 
Rugvinikaya or Niddna (eighth or ninth century a.d.), Vpida’s Siddhayoga 
(eighth or ninth century a.d.), Cakrapanidatta’s Cakrasamgraha or Cikitsd- 
sdrasamgraha (c. a.d. 1050), Sarngadhara’s Samhitd (thirteenth century 
A.D.), Vangasena’s Cikitsdsamgraha (eleventh or twelfth century a.d.), 
Bhavami§ra’s Bhdvaprakd§a (sixteenth century a.d.) and numerous other 
monographs, nighanfus (medical lexicons) and commentaries. 

The Unani System of Medicine 

The principal sources on which the Unani system of medicine, as 
practised and developed in India, depended are the Firdausid-Hikmat by

A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


‘Ali b. Rabban (a.d. 850), the QdnUrt of ibn Sina (a.d. 980-1036) and several 
works by other leading Arab physicians. Although, to start with, the 
system was based primarily on the Greek system, it was later on enriched 
by the experiences of the Arab physicians as also by the Ayurvedic system 
to which they had access. From about the thirteenth or fourteenth century 
A.D., practitioners of the Unani system in India produced a number of 
important medical works. Thus, in a.d. 1320, Hakim Diya Muhammad 
wrote his Majmuai-Diyaiyya. This work refers to an earlier work, the 
Majmuai-Shamaiyya, a Persian translation of an Ayurvedic book, by Shams- 
uddin Mustaufi. Other works include the Tibbe Firozshahi dictated by 
Firoz Shah Tughlaq himself; the Macdanush-Shifai-Sikandari compiled, 
under the orders of Mian Bhowa, by a number of Hakims and Ayurvedic 
physicians; the Tibbi-ShifauhKhani and the Tibbe-Shihabi by Hakim Shaha- 
buddin (fifteenth century a.d.); the Tibbe-Shifai-Mahmudi (fourteenth 
century) during the reign of Mahmud Shah, the Bahamanid ruler of the 
Deccan ; a Persian translation of Vagbhata’s work by Hakim ‘Ali Muhammad 
(fifteenth-sixteenth century a.d.) and the Dasturil-Atbba, also called the 
IkhtiyarathQasim, by Hakim Muhammad Qasim Hindu Shah (a.d. 1590). 

Under the Mughal rulers, the system received further encouragement. 
A large number of Hakims and Ayurvedic physicians were engaged in 
producing commentaries, translations, etc., of original Arabic works and 
also in translating and adapting Ayurvedic works. Thus, we have the 
Tibbi’Aurangzebi'y the Muslajati-Darashikohii the Talifi~Sharifi and the 
Tuhfa-Alamshahi by Hakim Sharif Khan (a.d. 1725-1806), the Iksiri-Azam 
by Hakim Muhammad Azan, and the Jami ush-Shifaiya by Hakim Afdal 
Ali of Faydabad (a.d. 1878). 

Veterinary Science 

Diseases of animals and their treatment received no less attention in 
ancient and medieval India. Cows, horses and elephants received special 
consideration in view of their importance in Indian economy, and it is 
not surprising that a sizeable literature has come down to us, dealing with 
the diseases of these animals. The Gavayurveda attributed to Gotama is 
concerned with the diseases of bovine animals and their treatment. On 
the equine Ayurveda^ the most important work is the Sdlihotra Samhitd of 
uncertain date, although great antiquity is claimed for its legendary author 
Salihotra. It was redacted by Kalhana (twelfth century a.d.) under the 
title Sdlihotrasdrasamuccaya. Other important books on the subject are 
the Ahavaidyaka of Jayadatta Sflrl and the Ahaidstra by Nakula, both 
of uncertain dates.** The medical encyclopaedia, the Rdjamdrtan4a, by 
Bhojaraja, which contains several references to veterinary sciences, mentions 
the Sdrasamgraha, another work by Nakula, the Hayalildvati by Jayadeva 
and the Vdjicikitsd Samgraha by Jayadatta. On elephants, the classical

work is the PdlakSpya SamhM, also known as the Hastyayurveda, attri- 
buted to Palakapya, but compiled most probably by one of his disciples 
in medieval times.® 

latrochemical and Alchemical Texts 

It is difficult to say since when metallic preparations, inorganic salts 
and alloys, particularly the preparations of mercury, began to find use in 
the treatment of diseases in India. The use of mercurial compounds and 
a number of chemical processes such as calcination, making of alkalies, etc., 
were known to Su^ruta and Caraka. In the course of time such iatrochemi- 
cal practices and applications of inorganic remedies developed into a new 
branch of knowledge called the rasaidstra or the rasacikitsd school of 
medicine. Accordingly, the contents of this class of literature are discussed 
in the chapter on medicine from the iatrochemical point of view and in the 
chapter on chemical practices and alchemy, for their obvious contribution 
to the growth of alchemy. 

The specific literature on the subject began to develop from the seventh 
or eighth century A.D., but the most active period of its growth is noticed 
between the tenth and fourteenth century a.d. Here we mention only a 
few important texts and more will be noticed in chapters referred to. These 
are: the Rasaratndkara and the ArogyomaHjari of Siddha Nagaquna 
(seventh century a.d.), the Siddhayoga of Vrnda, Cakrasamgraha of Cakra- 
panidatta, Rasahrdaya of Govinda Bhagavat (eleventh century a.d.), 
Rasdrnava by an unknown author (twelfth century a.d.), Rasendracuddmani 
of Somadeva (twelfth-thirteenth century a.d.), Rasaratnasamuccaya by 
Vagbhata (twelfth century a.d.), Rasaprakd§asudhdkara by YaSodhara 
(c. twelfth-thirteenth century a.d.), and Rasendracintdmani by Ramacandra 
(twelfth century a.d.). Another Rasaratndkara^ attributed to Siddha 
Nityanatha, is likely to be a fourteenth-century work; some of the works 
belonging to the same century include Rasardjalaksmi by Vi§nudeva, 
physician to the king Bukka of Vijayanagar, Rasanak^atramdlikd by Matha- 
nasiipha, the Rasasdra by Govindacarya, Rasendra-sdrasamgraha by 
Gopalakr§na and Dhdturatnamdld by Devadatta.*' Although these rasa 
texts are not free from Tantrik elements, these are not regarded as typical 
Tantrik works either. On the other hand, typically Tantrik texts some- 
times deal with serious alchemical precepts, of which the Mdt^kdbhedatantra 
and the Rasdrnavakalpa of the Rudraydmalaiantra, in Sanskrit, are some 
examples. There is an abundant literature on the subject in languages 
other than Sanskrit, particularly in Tamil, in which the Siddha system 
under the name sittar flourished. 

Gunpowder and Pyrotechnics 

Apart from references to the making of gunpowder in general texts 
of the nature of SukranitU there exist a number of manuals in Sanskrit,

56 


A CONaSE HISTORY OF SOENCB IN INDIA 


Marathi, Tamil, Malayalam and Persian, dealing with gunpowder and 
pyrotechnics. Some of them are the Kautukacintamatfi by Prataparudra- 
deva (c. a.d. 1497-1539), AkaSabhairavakalpa {c. fifteenth century a.d.) 
in Sanskrit; the Rukminisayamvara by Ekanatha (c. sixteenth century a.d.) 
in Marathi; the BdnaSastra and the Bogarsutiram in Tamil; the Vetikkam- 
pavidhi by Nllakantha in Malayalam; and a Persian work on pyrotechnics 
by Zain-ul-Abidin (a.d. 1421-72). 

Botany, Agriculture and Zoology 

As we have already seen, archaeological sources provide a good deal 
of information from which some kind of reconstruction is possible as to 
the state of knowledge regarding these sciences during the pre- and proto- 
historic period. In the chapters concerned, such an attempt has been 
made. Then we have general literary sources such as the Sarphitas, the 
Brahmanas, the Upanisads, the Sutras, the Arthasastras and related works, 
the Epics, the Puranas, lexicographic, encyclopaedic and medical works,’ 
which contain bulk of the information relating to these subjects in a scat- 
tered form. Presentation of a coherent picture out of such scattered mass 
of materials is indeed a formidable task. 

We fortunately possess special treatises dealing with botany and agri- 
culture. The AgnipurSna, the ArthaMstra and the Brhatsamhita, by includ- 
ing a special chapter on Vrksayurveda, the Sanskrit name for plant science, 
clearly indicate the existence of a separate treatise on botany. Such Vfks- 
ayurveda texts written by ParaSara and Surapala are now available in manu- 
script form in a number of libraries in India.® A copy of a manuscript by 
Parasara has been noticed by N. N. Sircar; the work was possibly written 
between the first century b.c. and first century a.d. Surapala’s Vrksayur- 
veda possibly belonged to f. eleventh century a.d. The Krsi-Parasara, also 
known as Krsi-samgraha, Krsi-paddhati and Krsitantra, an important work 
on agriculture, was written between a.d. 950 and 1100.*' 

For information concerning botany, agriculture and zoology in the 
Medieval Period, we have likewise to depend largely on historical chronicles 
available in the form of memoirs, and administrative and revenue literature 
of which, as we have already remarked, the A’ in is our most valuable source.’ 

Sciences in the Modern Period 

In the present book it has not been our intention to deal with the 
history of modern sciences in India in the same pattern followed for the 
previous periods. Significantly, therefore, our last chapter has been styled 
as the impact of Western science on India up to the end of the nineteenth 
wntury. The materials of the Modem Period are very vast indeed. We 
have simply to recal l the enormous amount of records such as the Minutes

of the Bengal Council, Military, Public, Political and Revenue Consultations 
of Bengal, Bombay and Madras, Court Despatches to Bengal, Bombay 
and Madras, Records of the Medical Board, the various Surveys and 
scientific establishments and the bewildering amount of scientific papers, 
memoirs, books and monographs produced during the period. The study 
and analyses of these materials for reconstructing the history of science 
of the Modem Period involve a lifetime’s work by several scholars. Craw- 
ford’s History of Medical Service in India, 1600-1913, in two volumes 
(1914), Phillimore’s Historical Records of the Survey of India, in four volumes 
(1945-58), and Burkill’s Chapters in the History of Botany in India (1965) 
are a few examples of what is involved in this kind of study. Even then 
these works were concerned with specially selected areas. The magnitude 
of an integrated study of the history of science of the period with a balanced 
emphasis on the role of historical, social, economic and political forces in 
the development of scientific institutions and of sciences themselves can be 
easily understood. Unlike the previous periods, here the advantage is 
that the materials are readily available without presenting formidable 
linguistic difficulties inherent in oriental studies pertaining to the Ancient 
and the Medieval and the disadvantage is that such materials are too vast. 




ASTRONOMY 

S. N. Sen 


Man’s interest in the heavens is perhaps as old as the beginning of his 
career as homo sapiens on this planet. This is doubtless a consequence 
of his erect posture which enables him to look and wonder at the sky and 
the various striking phenomena occurring there day by day and night by 
night. The sun, the moon, the vault of the sky with numerous sparkling 
stars, bright and dim, must have appealed to him at the dawn of his capacity 
to wonder at, and indulge in certain amount of speculation about them. 
Moreover, he was impressed by the regularity of appearance and disappear- 
ance of these objects. The sequence of day and night, the obvious 
connection of the sun with such alteration of light and darkness, the regular 
revelation of the splendour of the nightly sky, the periodic waxing and 
waning of the moon and the unchanging character of the stellar vault must 
have fired the imagination of the primitive man. 

It did not perhaps take the primitive man a long time to discover 
some kind of relationship between the cycle of his activities and the regu- 
larity of the heavenly phenomena. Thus were differentiated his day-time 
activities from the nocturnal. He noticed that his hunting seasons and, 
more particularly, his sowing times, when he settled down as a primitive 
agriculturist, depended on climatic changes or the seasons. He vaguely 
felt that these periodic changes were somehow connected with the most 
conspicuous of all heavenly bodies, the sun. In lower Egypt the periodical 
overflowing of the Nile was noticed to have some connection with the 
heliacal rising of Sirius, ] 

Such cycle of events in the life processes on the one hand and the regu- 
larity in the heavenly phenomena on the other inevitably led to a time sense. 
At the same time these suggested methods of marking and measuring time 
to an intelligent priestly class wherever human civilizations sprang up 
and had their normal course of development. This prieStly class, as is 
well known, had a dominant role to play in human societies, with powers to 
regulate religious and, not infrequently, the secular life of their fellow 
members. Everywhere they evolved an elaborate and complicated system 
of rituals and sacrifices to be performed with perfect regularity in time. 
This naturally imposed on them the task of measuring and dividing tim e of,

in other words, of evolving a suitable calendar and consequently of studying 
astronomical phenomena. This is true as much of the temple priests of 
Thebes, Nineveh, Sumer and Akkad as of the Brahmanas of Vedic India. 

The whole corpus of the Vedic literature represents the intellectual 
activity of a sacerdotal caste which, by turning to account the religious 
instincts of a gifted and devout race, transformed a primitive worship of 
the powers of nature into a highly artificial system of sacrificial ceremonies. 
In prescribing rules for the observance of such ceremonies, the priestly 
leaders never tired of emphasizing the importance of carrying them out 
in proper times. This clearly envisaged a dependable calendar. Thus, the 
building of the different types of fire altars and consecration {agnyadhdna), 
or the holding of seasonal sacrifices (cdturmdsydni)^ the full-moon sacri- 
fices, the soma feast lasting a year, the yearly sattras and so on involved 
knowledge of a workable calendar and presupposed a class of priests 
skilled in time-reckoning. 

In the sacred literature of the Hindus, the Jainas and the Buddhists, 
such a skilled priest has been referred to as ‘astronomer* and his science 
‘astronomy’ (jyotisa). In the Mun<faka Upanisad^ astronomy is included 
in the list of several branches of Vedic studies. The Chandogya Upanisad^ 
has it that Narada, upon being interrogated by Sanat Kumara as to the 
range of his knowledge, replied, ‘I have learnt the Rgveda, the Yajurveda^ 
the Samaveda and the fourth the Atharvaveda; the Itihasa and the 
Purdna as the fifth Veda\ grammar, the science par excellence; the 
obsequies of Manu; the art of computation; omens; the revolutions of 
periods; speech; ethics; scriptures; sciences appendant on holy writings 
(accentuation, prosody, etc.); the abjuration of spirits; the military science; 
astronomy; snake-charming; music and mechanical arts (sciences of the 
demi-gods).’ In explaining the scope of astronomy, the Veddnga Jyotisa 
states: ‘The Vedas are revealed for the purpose of performing sacrificial 
rites; these rites are laid down in order of time. Therefore, he who is 
versed in astronomy, the science of the reckoning of time, knows the 
sacrifices.* In the Brdhmana literature, we come across the term naksatra- 
darJa meaning ‘a star gazer* or ‘a gazer at the lunar mansions*. This 
term has also been used sometimes to mean an astrologer. Another term 
used to refer to an astronomer is ganaka which literally means ‘a calculator* 
or ‘a mathematician*. The use of these two terms appears to imply the 
study of astronomy both from the practical (observation of stars) and 
theoretical (calculation) considerations. 

The Jainas also claim considerable antiquity for their interest in, and 
study of, astronomy. The four branches of their canonical texts include 
ganitdnuyoga (principles of mathematics), sarpkhydna (arithmetic) and 
iyoti^a (astronomy).^ Like the Brahma^as, the Jainas, too, demanded of 
their priests great proficiency in astronomy for the proper observance of

their religious ceremonies. The Buddhists did not evince much interest 
in astronomy due probably to the degeneration in their time of astronomy 
into astrology, and to the difficulty of distinguishing between the two. We 
find in their literature the term naksatra-pathaka (a reader of stars) which 
refers both to an astronomer and an astrologer. Buddha referred to astron- 
omy and astrology as low forms of arts (tiracchdna vijjd) and advised 
Buddhist monks to refrain from the study of astronomy.® This opinion, 
however, was modified later on and the bhiksus dwelling in the woods were 
advised to learn the elements of astronomy. 

From what has been stated above, and will appear in what follows, 
there is no doubt that astronomy was cultivated to a considerable extent 
in India in the Vedic times. The selection of a few fixed stars for the 
development of a system of lunar mansions, the fixation of a sdvana year 
of 360 days, based upon the variation of the length of day, the elaboration 
of a quinquennial cycle with intercalary months, going back to the time 
of the Rgveda, the idea of the four mundane ages and several other findings 
abundantly show their interest and proficiency in astronomy. This 
Brahmanic interest and proficiency did not also escape the notice of foreign 
observers and writers, for Megasthenes found the yuga system flourishing in 
full perfection and Strabo referred to astronomy as a favourite occupation of 
the Brahma^as.^ 


ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE AS REVEALED IN THE 
SAMHITAS, BRAHMANAS and SUTRAS 

Before summarizing the astronomical information contained in this 
vast body of the sacred literature, a few general remarks may be made 
here. Of the various sacerdotal families such as those of Gftsamada. 
Vi^vamitra, V^madeva, Atri, Bharadvaja and Vasi§tha, who originated 
some of the oldest hymns, the family of Atri was probably distinguished 
for their interest in astronomy. Atri’s name is frequently mentioned in 
connection with eclipse hymns both in the Samhitds and the Brahmanas, 
The Sdmaveda and its Brahmanas and Sutras are full of interest from the 
viewpoint of calendrical astronomy because of their fuller treatment 
of gavdm ayana and the sattras of various durations, built round the daily 
progress of the sun. The various recensions of the Yajurveda are by far 
the most important of this class of literature from the viewpoint of the 
early history of Hindu astronomy. While the naksatras are doubtless 
mentioned in the Rgveday their whole series, numbering 27 or 28 and headed 
by Kfttikds, turns up for the first time in the recensions of the Yajurveda. 
These texts are again repositories of several mythologies developed around 
stellar constellations. The details of darsapurnamasa, i.e. the new- and full- 
moon sacrifices, the caturmdsya or four-monthly sacrifices, seasons, months

and month names, are here met with. The importance of the winter solstice 
is emphasized through the mahavrata rites which are also dealt with at 
length in the Brahmanas of the Samaveda, The number 10,800 used to 
specify the bricks required for some types of altars appears to be related 
to the length of the astronomical yuga characteristic of the later Siddhanta- 
jyotisa texts. The ga\am ayana and the sattras, probably taken over from 
the Samaveda and its Brahmanas^ find lengthy treatment in these Yajus 
texts. The Atharvaveda offers little assistance towards our understanding 
of the nature and extent of the Vedic astronomy. Nevertheless, it does 
contain stray passages of astronomical consequence, such as the solar 
eclipse, the mention of Rdhu for the first time, intercalation with a thirteenth 
month and a list of 28 naksatras including Abhijit, Finally, its cosmogonic 
and theosophic hymns addressed to Goddess Earth, the glorification of the 
sun, and the personification of time as a primordial power have also some 
relevance to this study. 

The Brahmanas are systematized theological works composed for 
the main purpose of elucidating the sacrificial texts and explaining the 
origin and hidden meaning of sacrifices. Each Satphita gave rise to a 
number of Brahmanas. In this way astronomical ideas and precepts 
embedded in the Samhitds assumed clearer perspective through Brahmaijic 
interpretations. As the materials of the Sa/phitds and the Brahmanas 
constitute the basis of the sutras, passages in them of astronomical import 
have received fresh treatment and sometimes further elaboration at the 
hands of the sutrakdras. Such is particularly the case with regard to the 
Vedic calendars. Although the elements and suggestions of such calendars 
are met with in the Vedas proper, different modes of year-reckoning and 
calendar-keeping appear clearly in the siitras. The Ldfydyana ^rautasutra 
and the Niddnasutra of the Sdmaveda are particularly important for this 
purpose. The Sulba-sutras forming part of the Kalpasutras, as we shall 
see in the section on mathematics, are important as the oldest Indian works 
on geometry. Finally, we have two dyotisa-Veddfigas, one in the Yajurveda 
recension containing 43 verses and the other in the Rgveda recension con- 
taining 36 verses, dealing exclusively with astronomy. 

THE SUN, THE MOON, THE EARTH AND PLANETS 

The Sun 

From the Rgvedic times the universe was regarded as divided into 
three distinct regions, the earth {prthm)^ the firmament (antarik^a) and 
the heaven (dyaus). Each region again had a threefold subdivision. The 
sun during its sojourn through the universe illuminates and sustains all 
these regions and their subdivisions. These ideas have been repeatedly 
expressed in several hynms and verses of the Rgveda, such as ‘ the sun hath 
filled the air and earth and heaven’,® ‘Ye Gods who yonder have your 
home in the three lucid realms of heaven’,«» and more fully elsewhere.®

A CONCISE fflSTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


The ‘threefold earth’, the ‘triple sphere of light’ and similar threefold division 
of the intermediate region, the sky, have been further elaborated in the 
Brahmamsy as witness the following passage of Xht Pancavirrih Brdhmafta 

‘Through fire, earth and plants, thereby this world is threefold: 
through wind, intermediate region and birds, thereby that world is 
threefold, which stands between; through sun, sky and stars, thereby 
yonder world is threefold.’ 

The Rgvedic verses also bring out very clearly the important part 
played by the sun as a beneficial power in the Vedic mythology and also 
its various roles in nature. By its light it not only reveals the worlds, but 
regulates them, and sustains life on the earth. Although it illuminates 
the worlds, it also causes the constellations with their weak beams to pass 
away, like thieves, before its all-beholding rays of light. ^ These rays of light 
are seven in colour, for ‘ where these seven rays are shining, thence my house 
and family extend’^^ and are often likened to the sun god’s ‘bay coloured 
horses, bright, changing hues, which speed round earth and heaven.’^ 

As to its regulating powers in nature, it is the cause of the flowing 
of the floods and the winds and is the maker of time through the alteration 
of day and night, the twilight, month and year. Regarding day and night 
the Aitareya Brdhmana^ of the Pgveda states that the sun neither sets nor 
rises. After reaching the end of the day, it only changes about and 
in the process makes night below and day on the other side. After 
reaching the end of the night, the sun makes day below and night on the 
reverse side. According to another naive interpretation, the sun was here 
represented as possessing a bright and a dark face; at the end of the day, 
the sun’s dark face was turned towards the earth making night below and 
the bright face upwards illuminating the stars in the upper regions of the 
heaven. 

The Sun's Path, the Ecliptic 

There are several references in the f^gveda and in the Brahmanas of 
the later ages to the sun’s path through the heavens. Varu^a, the chief 
of the Lords of natural order, has made a spacious pathway for the sun 
to travel./ This path called rta is easy to find. Elsewhere, it is referred 
to as Aryaman’s mighty path: ‘How may we pass the wicked on the path 
of mighty Aryaman? Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.’fl' The 
Pahcavifjjh Brdhmana speaks of this path as follows: ‘By means of this 
(rite), Aryaman gained the world. The path called Aiyaman’s path is the 
path leading to the Gods. They who undertake this (rite) reach the path 
leading to the Gods.’* According to the Satapatha Brdhmaria, ‘to Brhaspati 
belongs that upper region, and there above lies that path of Aryaman (the

sun)/® These passages have been interpreted in two ways. Weber regarded 
Aiyaman’s path as the milky way; Hillebrandt, Ludwig and others as the 
ecliptic. Ludwig further traced the inclination of the ecliptic to the equator 
in another passage of the ^veda in which the ^hhus are described as 
wandering afar in their path. 

From the way Aryaman’s path is described it is not immediately easy 
to associate it with the ecliptic, but such inference is quite possible from 
the knowledge of the Vedic Hindus about the sun’s annual revolution, its 
going northward {uttardyam) for half of the year and southward {daksin- 
dyana) for the remaining half, the references to solstices and other related 
matters. Of further significance in this regard is the occurrence of such 
terms as devaydna and pitrydna from which Tilak attempted to derive the 
knowledge of equinoxes in the Vedic times and therefore of the celestial 
equator, the ecliptic and their inclination.*' 

The Moon 

The moon, the next most conspicuous object in the night sky, receives 
such appellations as candra, candramas and soma. It has no light of its 
own, but assumes ‘the brilliancy of the sun*<^ or ‘is adorned with Surya’s 
arrowy beam’,^ that is it shines with the borrowed light of the sun. The 
phases of the moon are described by saying that the moon, ‘born afresh, is 
new and new for ever’.^' Some of its phases received special names and 
personifications. Thus, the day before the new moon was called simydli, 
the new moon day kuhut the day preceding the full moon anumati and the 
full moon day rdkd. An allegorical description of the sun swallowing the 
moon on the new moon day so that it can neither be seen in the eastern 
nor the western sky is preserved in the ^atapatha Brdhmana^ as follows: 

‘Now the one that bums there (viz. the sun) is, assuredly, no other 
than Indra, and that moon is no other than Vftra. But the former 
is of a nature hostile to the latter, and for this reason, though this one 
(the moon, Vftra) had previously (to the night of new moon) risen 
at a great distance from him (the sun, Indra), he now swims towards 
him and enters into his open mouth. 

‘Having swallowed him, he (the sun) rises; and that (other) one 
is not seen either in the east or in the west . . . 

‘Having sucked him empty, he throws him out; and the latter, thus 
sucked out, is seen in the western sky, and again increases; he again 
increases to serve that (sun) as food . . . ’ 

The above passage sets forth the moon’s elongation from the sun, its 
true motion from west to east and the cause of the new and full moon. 

The interval between the consecutive new moons or full moons was 
seized upon at quite an early date as a natural unit of time, the month,

in much the same way as it was done by the people of other culture areas, 
the Babylonians, the Greeks and so on. From several verses and passages 
stating that the year consists of 360 days and of 12 months, it appears that 
a month of 30 days was widely accepted in the time of the Sarjthitas and 
the Brahmanas. The month was again divided into two natural halves, 
the light half (M/fl) from new to full moon and the dark half {ki^na) from 
full to the new moon. The ^tgvedic bard had thus no hesitation in pro- 
claiming:® 

‘ Twelve are the fellies, and the wheel is single; three are the 
naves. What man hath understood it? 

* Therein are set together spokes three hundred and sixty, 
which in no wise can be loosened.* 

The moon’s synodic period was later on more correctly given as 29J 
days. Its sidereal period lying between 27 and 28 days appears to have 
been correctly formulated in the days of the early Samhitds as is clear from 
the development of the 27 or 28 nak$atra system. 

The Solar Eclipse 

Observation of the solar eclipse is recorded in several places in the 
Vedic literature in the form of the well-known Svarbhanu legend. According 
to its earliest Rgvedic version,^ Svarbhanu, the asura, pierced the sun with 
darkness so completely that the bewildered inhabitants on the earth did 
not know where they were standing. Then Atri, with the power of his 
prayers, caused Svarbhanu’s magic arts to disappear and restored the sun 
to its brilliance. The Svarbhanu legend and Atri’s part in ending the 
eclipse appear in a number of places in the Pancavitpsa Brdhmanay of which 
a typical description runs as follows 

‘The Daemoniac Svarbhanu struck the sun with darkness; the 
Gods did not discern it (the sun hidden as it was by darkness): they 
resorted to Atri; Atri repelled its darkness by the bhdsa. The part 
of the darkness he first repelled became a black sheep, what (he repelled) 
the second time (became) a silvery (sheep), what (he repelled) the third 
time (became) a reddish one, and with what (arrow) he set free its 
original appearance (colour), that was a white sheep.’ 

The interesting feature of the above passage is the detailed observation 
of the change of colour in the sun’s disc during the progress of an eclipse. 

The frequent and consistent references to Atri in connection with 
cchpses doubtless indicate a class of Brahmaija priests skilled in eclipse 
observations and in astronomy in general. The eclipse hymns of the 
figveda contain an expression turlyepa brahmapd which, according to some 
scholars, meant a kind of quadrant; but such interpretation is far-fetched.

The Earth 

It is difficult to say definitely if the Vedic Hindus regarded the earth 
as spherical. The sphericity of the earth may be implied in such casual 
statements as the earth is freely suspended in air,® the dawn precedes the 
sunrise^ and the like. In the cosmogonic and theosophic hymns of the 
Atharvaveda^ the earth and the heaven have been imagined as constituting two 
hemispheres which the Brahmacarin guards with his creative power. This 
and statements like the placing of fire between two receptacles or the union 
of two agnis between the two hemispheres of the world suggest terrestrial 
sphericity, later on accepted uniformly in Hindu astronomical texts. 

The Planets 

The study of planets appears in late astronomical works. The Vedahga 
Jyotisa does not mention them. But this does not mean that the Vedic 
Hindus were altogether unacquainted with planets. Weber did not notice 
the mention of planets in any texts earlier than the Taittirlya Aranyaka. 
In the Maltrayani Upanisad, planets (graha) are mentioned. In the early 
astronomical samhitas, planets are mentioned in the context of their 
astrological implications. Planet worship is established in Yajnavalkya’s 
law-book and is mentioned in the epics, and in the dramas of Kalid.isa 
and in the Mrcchakatika. Opinion, however, differs as to whether earlier 
Vedic works contain any evidence of the knowledge of planets. The 7 
ddityas mentioned in the Rgveda^ were interpreted by Oldenberg as 
referring to the sun, the moon and the 5 planets. The number 34 used 
to express, in hymn X. 55.4, the lights with which Indra looks around 
him and, in hymn J, 162.18, the ribs of the sacrificial horse has been 
explained by Ludwig as referring to the sun, the moon, 5 planets and 
27 naksairas. 

More convincing perhaps is the association of Bfhaspati, Lord of 
Prayer, with the planet Jupiter. The Taittiriya Brahmana refers to the 
conjunction of Brhaspati with the naksatra Tisya. The planet’s first birth 
‘from mighty splendour in supremest heaven’ is also referred to in the 
Rgveda. The Rgveda and the Brdhmanas contain the words ^ukra^ manthin 
and vena, and attempts have been made to associate them with the planet 
Venus; but this interpretation has not found acceptance with all scholars. 

Rdhu and Ketu 

To the seven planets, including the sun and the moon, the Indians 
added Rdhu and Ketu, to formulate their Rdhu-Ketu theories of eclipses. 
The word Rdhu, in the sense of a planet, appears in the Atharvaveda and 
the Chdndogyopani$ad apparently with no astronomical meaning, but in 
the YdJHavalkyasmrti it does so in the astronomical sense. The word

A CONCISE lilSTOKY Ol SCIENCE IN INDIA 


Kelu also appears in the Atharvaveda in the sense of any unusual or strik- 
ing phenomenon such as comet, meteor or a falling star. Astronomical 
sanihitQs, however, do not mention Ketu as a cause of eclipse. Rahu 
and Ketu, along with planets, are mentioned in the Mahabharata, though 
Ketu is omitted in the Ramayana. From Varahamihira onwards, in 
true astronomical circles, Rdhu and Ketu meant the ascending and the 
descending node respectively of the moon. 

The ingenious Rdhu-Ketu theory of eclipse travelled from India to 
China and appeared in a Chinese astronomical text Chiu Chih. This 
Chiu Chih was the Chinese version of an Indian calendrical work called 
Navagraha and its translator was the well-known Tantric-Buddhist astrono- 
mer Chhuthan Hsi-Ta who flourished at the Thang court during the first 
quarter of the eighth century a.d. 


THE STARS, THE NAKSATKA SYSTEM AND THE LUNAR ZODIAC 

Unlike the Babylonians or the Chinese, the ancient Indian astronomers 
were not particularly interested in the study of stars as such and in the 
preparation of star catalogues. They were primarily interested in the study 
of the motions of the sun and the moon with a view to developing a work- 
able calendar. As such their interest in stars and constellations largely 
centred round those which lie along or near the ecliptic. By a careful 
selection of suitable stars and constellations they were able to provide a 
stellar frame of reference against which to follow and measure planetary 
motions. A number of ancient civilizations— the Indian, the Chinese, 
the West Asian and the Egyptian — developed and perfected such a stellar 
frame of reference to mark the path of the sun and the moon. The system 
came to be known as that of the nak^atras among the Indians, of the hsius 
among the Chinese, of manazil among the Arabs and so on. 

The origin of the Indian nak^atra system has been traced to the Jjigveda, 
where the term naksatra has been used both in the sense of stars and lunar 
mansions. In the former sense it appears in I. 50.2; VII. 86.1 ; X. 68.11 and 
in several hymns. The sun is also sometimes identified with stars. In the 
sense of lunar mansions, at least two nak^atras are clearly mentioned, namely 
Magha (Agha) and Phalgunis {Arjutiis), as in the thirteenth verse of the 
sun’s bridal hymn 85 in the tenth man4(ilo : 

‘ The bridal pomp of SUrya, which Savitar started, moved along. 

In Magha days arc oxen slain, in Arjunis they wed the bride.’* 

Although other nak^atras arc not specifically named, Ludwig, Zimmer 
and others held that 27 nak^atras were already known when the icas were 
formed and included in the number 34 (the sun, the moon, 5 planets and 
27 nak^atras) previously referred to. Their use in the sense of lunar 
mansions is also stated clearly in another expression: ‘Thus Soma in the 
midst of all these constellations hath his place.’*

A CONCISL HISTORY Of SCIENCE IN INDU 


The full list of 27 or 28 naksatras headed by Krttikds appears in the 
various recensions of the Black Yajurveda and in the Atharvaveda. Table 2.1 
gives the full list of naksatras as found in the Samhitds, in the Veddhga 
Jyoti^a and in later astronomical siddhantas (the list given in the Surya- 
siddhanta is given here). 

It is clear from the table that the nak^atra names have remained 
practically the same since their formulation in the Vedic times. The 
nak^atra Abhijit does not appear in all the lists, making the number some- 
times 27 and sometimes 28. It appears only in the Maitrdyani Samhitd, 
the Atharvaveda, the Taittiriya Brdhmana and some Siddhantic texts, but 
the star does not have associated with it any naksatra space. This 
nak^atra space requires some clarification. The term naksatra has been 
used to indicate both asterisms, stars or star-groups, and any of the 27 
equal divisions of the ecliptic, each distinguished by a determinant star 
(yoga tdrd). Derived from nakta-tra, it means ‘guardian of night’, that 
is stars or star-groups, and in this sense the word must have been used 
at the beginning. Later on, naksatra meant one of the 27 equal parts, 
that is a space of 13*^ 20' or 800' of the ecliptic. In the Surya-sid- 
dhdnta and such later astronomical works, a naksatra division of 800' 
has been clearly defined, and the positions of the determinant or junction 
stars have been given in degrees and minutes with respect to the starting 
point of the naksatra concerned. These values have been given in accord- 
ance with a system of polar coordinates — the polar longitudes (dhruvaka) 
and latitudes (hra) — from which true longitudes and latitudes or right 
ascensions and declinations can be calculated for comparison with current 
stellar positions. Colebrooke, Burgess and Whitney and other historians 
of Hindu astronomy have carried out these conversions and identified 
Hindu naksatras with those given in modern star catalogues. Some of 
these identifications, the Hindu stellar configurations and the legends built 
round them are summarized below. 

The Naksatras and Constellations 

Krttikd is a group of 6 or 7 stars known as Pleiades; the dominant 
star is rj Tauri (magnitude 3). According to the Yajurveda, this group 
consists of 7 stars and, according to al-BirunI and other texts, of 6 stars. 
It corresponds to the Chinese hsieu Mao and the mandzil ath-Thuraiya. 
Rohini has been identified with Aldebaran or a Tauri (magnitude 0-9). 
Mfga^ir^a figured as the ‘antelope’s head’ is a group of 3 stars, A, and (f>'^ 
in Orion. Around Rohini and Mi^ga^ir^a developed the Prajfipati legend 
given in the Aiiareya and the Satapatha Brdhmana. Lord Prajapati once 
fell in love with his own daughter Rohird and in the form of a deer pursued 
her as she was running away in the form of a female deer. Enraged at 
such incestous chase, the gods ordered Rudra to stop the chase, whereupon 
Rudra assumed the form of a hunter (Mjgavyddha) and pierc^ Prajapati 
with his arrow. The head of the antelope with the arrow sticking to it 
became the constellation MigaSlrfa. 



ASTRONOMY 


69 


Ptmarvasu is the twin stars Castor and Pollux in the constellation of 
Gemini. Pusya is a group of 3 to 5 faint stars in Cancri. A^re^ds (or 
Aslesds) and Maghd each is a cluster of 5 to 6 stars, the former in Hydrae 
and the latter in Leonis. Phaigmi is a double-star constellation in Leo. 
The five-starred Hasta, meaning hand, is in Corvus. Citrd is the readily 
identifiable brilliant star a Virginis or Spica of the first magnitude. So 
also in Nis^yd or Svdtl, the brilliant a Bootis or Arcturus (magnitude 0 0). 
To Visdkhd are attached sometimes 2 and sometimes 4 stars in Librae and 
to Anurddhd 4 stars in Scorpionis. Jye^fhd is a trio in Scorpio, of which 
the determinant star is Antares or a Scorpionis (magnitude 0-8). 

Ahhijit (determinant a Lyrae) has no naksatra space assigned to it in 
the ecliptic. Its 3 stars form a triangle in Lyra. It is mentioned only 
in texts giving a list of 28 naksatras, but not in those giving one of 27. 
This might mean a later addition to, or even dropping out from, the original 
list and received much attention in connection with the question of origin 
of the naksatra system and its relationship with similar systems in other 
civilizations. 

§rom or Sravana (determinant a Aquilae) is a constellation of 3 stars 
in Aquilae; the four-starred Dhanisfhd is in Delphinus; and Satabhi^aj, 
meaning ‘having one hundred physicians’, is a thickly studded cluster in 
Aquarii. The two Bhadrapadas are twin star-groups in Pegasi. RevatJ, 
a group of 32 stars, has its determinant star in { Piscium (magnitude 5-5). 
The end of this naksatra (according to the Surya-siddhdnta, 13° 10' from 
the beginning of RevafI or 359° 50' with respect to the First Point of Aries) 
or the beginning of Asvinl, the next naksatra in Aries marked the initial 
point of the Hindu sphere about a.d. 572. 

The Naksatra and Lunar Mansions of Other Nations 

We have said that a number of nations of antiquity, notably the 
Chinese, the Arabs and the Babylonians, followed a system of lunar mansions 
analogous to that of the naksatras. Whether all these systems had a 
common origin or had developed independently became naturally enough 
a subject of considerable discussion and controversy. The Sinologists, 
the Indianists and the Assyriologists laid powerful claims on the anteriority 
as well as the originality of their respective systems, and not unoften 
suggested borrowing by other nations of the system they considered native 
to the culture area of their preference. But the question has still remained 
very much an open one. 

The Hsius 

The Chinese hsius were originally selected to mark the equator and 
facilitate observation of the culmination of stars.® In their system a 
series of circumpolar stars were keyed to equatorial stars so that, by observ- 
ing the lower meridional transits of the former, those of the latter below 


Needham, m, pp. 242-52. 



70 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDU 


the horizon could be readily ascertained. The declination circles passing 
through the selected equatorial and the corresponding drcumpolar stars 
divid^ the equator into a number of unequal segments called the hsius. 
At least two of the hsiu stars, the Bird Star (oc Hydrae) and the Fire Star 
(n Scorpii), have been recognized in the carvings of the oracle-bones belong- 
ing to the Shang period (1500 b.c.). The Book of Odes {Shih Ching) 
believed to have come down from the eighth or ninth century b.c. records 
about 8 hsius. The use of four quadrantal hsius, e.g. Fang (middle of 
Eastern Palace), Hsu (middle of Northern Palace), Mao (middle of Western 
Palace) and Hsing (middle of Southern Palace), is met with in the Historical 
Classic (eighth to fifth century b.c.). The Lesser Annuary of the Hsia Dynasty 
(fourth century b.c.), a kind of farmer’s calendar, mentions all the four quad- 
rantal stars plus two more, Wei Scorpii) and Liu (8 Hydrae). A fuller 
list of hsius—23 out of 28— is given in the Records of Rites of Younger Tai 
(first century b.c.). The full list of 28 hsius, however, appears for the first 
time in Huai Nan Tzu (160 or 150 b.c.) and, more importantly, as a lunar 
zodiac and not as equatorial stars of earlier records. 

Thus the full list of 28 hsius appeared in China several centuries later 
than did the nak^atra list in the various recensions of the Black Yajurveda. 
As a lunar zodiac, the Chinese system did not emerge before the fourth 
century b.c., if not later. As to the hsius themselves, many of them differ 
importantly from the naksatras. Nine naksatras agree with the corre- 
sponding hsius both in regard to their determinant stars and more or less with 
the number of stars attached to the constellations. For 11 naksatras, the 
determinants are different although they belong to the same constellations. 
For the remaining 8 naksatras and hsius, the determinant stars were selected 
from different constellations. 

The Mandzil 

The Arabian manUzils, 28 in number, agree on the whole with the 
Indian naksatras. Their lunar zodiac is headed by ash’Shara(dn, the first 
mandzil corresponding to naksatra Ahini which marked the point of 
intersection between the equator and the ecliptic about the fifth or sixth 
century a.d. As many as 19 mandzils agree with the corresponding 
naksatras; there are discrepancies with regard to Ardra, Hasta, Svdtf, 
Abhijit, §roi^, Sravi^fhd and Revati vis-d-vis the corresponding mandzils, 
Weber at one time believed that the Arabian lunar stations had been derived 
directly from the Indian naksatras. The recorded evidence of transmission 
of Indian astronomical texts, particularly the Siddhdntas, makes such a 
view attractive; but, as Filliozat (3) h^s pointed out, aU this, even the close 
resemblance between the two systems, does not ipso facto prove an Arab 
borrowing from India. Long before the beginning of active Arab scientific 
contacts with India during the reign of the Abbasid CaHphs, the manOzils 
found mention m the al-Qur’ftn (x. 5; xxxvi. 39). The Fihrist records that

sacrifices to the moon and performing other religious ceremonies on the

27th or 28th day of each month, from which Weber inferred far-fetchedly 
knowledge of lunar mansions among the Harranites.® Of greater con- 
sequence perhaps were his interpretations of the Hebrew word mazzaloth 
or mazzaroth in the Book of Job (38. 32) and Book of Kings (23. 5) to mean 
manazil and suggestion of Chaldean origin. Derivation of the manazil 
from an Iranian system was attempted by Leopold de Saussure. 


The Question of Babylonian Origin of Lunar Mansions 

Weber, Whitney and later on Hommel and other Assyriologists favoured 
the theory of a Babylonian origin of lunar mansions. The Babylonians, 
at quite an early date, developed the knowledge of constellations and its 
use in following the motions of the sun, the moon and planets. By about 
1100 B.c. they had divided the sky into three zones of 12 sectors each, 
these sectors containing the names of constellations, planets and simple 
numbers in arithmetic progression. Moreover, they assigned 3 stars or 
constellations to every month, which indicates an attempt to obtain some 
kind of correlation of months to constellations. 

A true zodiacal scheme is implied in the important series of texts 
known as ‘"‘^^APIN dated about 700 b.c., but based on older materials. 
These tablets give the names of about 18 constellations more or less along 
the ecliptic. Here are some of them: ““taul (Pleiades), “"^’gu^.an.na 
(Taurus), "‘“’UR.GU.LA (Leo), “^ab.Sln (Spica), ““‘PA.BIL.SAG (Sagit- 
tarius) and so on. Later texts appear either to multiply or to reduce 
the number of stars with a view to defining planetary positions more accu- 
rately and, in this manner, their number gradually rose to 33 or more as 
recorded in Babylonian ephemerides. 

The first attempt to construct out of 33 or 36 Babylonian normal 
stars a lunar zodiac composed of 24 ecliptic stars was due to Fritz Hommel 
of Munich.^' He compared the Babylonian stars with the Arabian 
mandzils, found agreement in respect of 16 stations and concluded that 
ih^mandzils were based on the more ancient Babylonian scheme. On the 
basis of the theory of common origin, HommePs work was taken to be 
an important argument in favour of the derivation of the various lunar 
zodiac schemes from the Babylonian. Thibaut raised a number of objections 
to such a view.<^ Between the nak^atras and the Babylonian ecliptic stars, 
agreement has been noticed in the case of about one-third of the total 
number. Mrga§lr§a, Ardra, A:Sresds, Hasta, Mula, Abhijit and :Sravi?{hds 
differ completely from their opposite numbers in the Babylonian series. 
Even in the agreement itself there is nothing very surprising if one bears 
in mind that, in all these separate attempts, the task was the same, namely 
to select a sraes of conspicuous asterisms near the ecliptic. In such 
circumstances it is inevitable that specially bright stars such as a Tauri, 
p Geminorum, a Leonis, a Virginis, a Scorpionis— all of the first magnitude—

or such well-defiBcd stars such as Pleiades, a and ^ Geminorum, a and p 
Librae should be selected. 

Another important objection is that the Babylonian series comprises 
33 or 36 stars, whereas the mamzil consists of 28 and the naksatra 27 or 28 
star-groups. Hommel tried to explain this by guessing that the lunar 
zodiacs of all nations had originally 24 stars or star-groups only, which 
were expanded into 27, 28 or even a larger number. The Chinese hsius, 
it is true, had 23 members at some early stage of their development, but 
such is not the case with either the mamzil or the naksatra, which from the 
beginning comprised of 27 or 28 stations. 

Thus the common origin hypothesis, with Babylon as the centre of 
diffusion, does not appear to rest on solid ground. The career in Babylon of 
a lunar zodiac proper is itself doubtful. There is no such doubt about the 
careers of the naksatras, the hsius or the manazils. Whether all these systems 
developed independently or had a common origin or to what extent one 
system influenced the other still remains largely a matter of speculation. 


DIVISION OF TIME— DAY, MONTH, SEASONS, VEDIC LUNI-SOLAR 
CALENDAR, SOLSTICES AND EQUINOXES 

The Day 

Both ‘day’ and ‘night’ appear as natural unit of time in the earliest 
literary productions of the Indians. Expressions like ‘many dawns and 
nights’, ‘days subdue the nights’ occur in the Rgyeda, As Haug has shown, 
the day in the Vedic times was generally taken to start and end with the 
sunset. The civil or natural day from sunrise to sunrise or from mid- 
night to midnight has been called sdxana day in later astronomical works. 
In the SuryO’SiddhQnta, terrestrial civil days are reckoned from sunrise 
to sunrise. Aryabhata reckoned it both from sunrise and from mid- 
night at Lanka. 

Day, that is the bright half, was divided, according to the Atharvaveda 
and the Taittirlya Brdhmana, into five parts, e.g. udyan suryakt (rising sun), 
saipgava (gathering of cows), madhyam-dina (midday), apardhna (afternoon) 
and astam~yan (sunset).® Further division of the day into muhurtas 
and still smaller units has been traced to the Brdhmam period. According 
to the ^atapatha Brahmana,^ ‘there are ten thousand and eight hundred 
muhurtas in the year (1 day = 30 muhurtas), and fifteen times as many 
kfiprus as there are muhurtas; and fifteen times as many iddni as there 
arc etarhi; and fifteen times as many breathings as there are iddni\ In 
the Sdhkhydyana Aranyakas the day is progressively subdivided into 
muhUrta, k$ana, kald, kdsfhd, nime^a and dhvarpsa. Kautilya’s Arthaidstra 
gives muhdrta, ndlikd, kald, kdsfhd, nimesa, lava and tufa as various units 
of time.

The experience of the variations of day-length with seasons must have 
been very ancient, but details of actual measurements and rules for cal- 
culating them at any time of the year appear rather late— about the time 
of the Veddnga Jyotisa. The increase of day-length from winter solstice 
to summer solstice and the corresponding decrease in the duration of the 
night are recorded in the Jyotisa. Here the day has 30 muhurtas, the 
shortest day-length at the winter solstice is given as 12 muhurtas and the 
longest at the summer solstice as 18 muhurtas. The total increase in day- 
length in one ayana of 183 days (according to the Jyotisa, a year has 366 
days) being 6 muhurtas, the rate of increase per day is given as 2/61. Weber 
suspected that the rule found in the Vedahga Jyotisa might have been 
imported to India from Babylon, for the latitude of which the above state- 
ments agree. But the results are also true for latitudes of parts of 
north-west India and could have been obtained as well by independent 
observations. 

A ‘solar’ day (saura-dina) as a time unit, defined as 360th part of the 
year, is hinted at in the Vedahga Jyotisa and also given in the Pahea- 
siddhdntikd. The sidereal day, defined as the time taken by the asterisms 
to complete one revolution, is met with in Hindu astronomy. Garga, 
in enumerating different kinds of day, makes a clear distinction between 
a sdvana and a ‘solar’ day 

A lunar day or tithi is 30th part of one lunation, that is the period 
in which the moon’s elongation increases by 12 degrees. A paksa or half 
lunation contains 15 tithis which are named by Sanskrit ordinals prathamd, 
dvitlyd, etc. The first tithi of either paksa is called pratipad and the last or 
the fifteenth purnimd or amdvdsyd depending on whether the paksa is bright 
or dark. A tithi is a calendrical device, but has not much astronomical 
significance except as an artificial division of the lunation. There is no 
indication of its development in the period of the samhitds. It appears 
fully developed in the Jyotisa and in the sutra literature. The Jyotisa 
and the sutras define a naksatra day as the thirtieth part of the time required 
by the moon to complete one revolution through 27 asterisms. 

The Month 

The reckoning of the month by the moon and the year by the sun was 
widespread among the ancient civilizations. The concept of the month 
as a unit of time based on lunation developed in the Vedic times. The 
^gveda describes the moon as ‘that which shapes the year’.® We have 
already referred to the riddle hymn describing the year of 360 days as a 
single wheel with 12 months of 30 days each. Two systems of month- 
reckoning, e.g. the amdnta and the purnimdnta, were in vogue. According 
to the former, a month has its beginning and end with the new moon; in 
the latter it is with the full moon. The Greeks, the Romans and the Jews 
also regarded their lunar months as lasting from the first appearance of the

crescent after any new moon till that of the next. Oldenburg was more 
favourably disposed to the amanta system. We also have it from al-Birun! 
that the amanta month was the canonical one. At the same time the 
derivation of the month names from the naksatras in which full moon 
takes place, as also the practice of starting the year with the full moon of 
the month, leave hardly any doubt that the purnimMa reckoning was equally 
in vogue in the time of the Brdhmanas» 

The names of the lunar months were derived from the naksatras in 
which the full moon occurred, e.g. PMlgma, Caitra, VaiMha, Jyaistha 
and so on from the naksatras PhalgunI, Citra, Vi^akha, Jye^fhd respectively. 
Another system of naming months after the seasons of the year also 
originated during the period of the Sarnhitds and the Brdhmanas. According 
to the Black Yajurveda, such seasonal or solar months are: spring months — 
Madhu, Madhava; summer months— ^uci; rain months-^Nabha, 
Nahhasya; autumn months— to, Urja; Dewy or Hemanta months— 
Sahasya', winter months-T^p^, Tapasya. A rough correspondence of

indicate that to all intents and purposes the year was originally divided 
into three seasons, e.g. the warm, the rainy and the cold. The corre- 
sponding sacrifices to be performed to mark the beginning of these three 
seasons were Vaiivadeva, Varuriapraghdsd and the Sakamedha, Very 
befittingly, these sacrifices are called rtu mukhmi in the ^atapatha Brdhmana, 
Two further seasons were in course of time added to the three primitive 
ones — the autum between the rainy and the cold and the spring between 
the cold and the warm season. Later on or concurrently, their number 
was expanded into six by the inclusion of the dewy season (hemanta or Mm). 
The Satapatha Brdhmana mentions sometimes five® and sometimes six^ 
seasons in the year. 

The Intercalary Month 

A year of 360 days divided into 12 months of 30 days each raises 
difficulties in the matter of adjusting the lunar months with the seasons. 
In the course of a few years the months would be out of step with the 
seasons. To make them agree with the seasons, it is necessary either to 
introduce an intercalary month at regular intervals or add the difference 
of 5 to 6 days to one or more months. There is evidence of both these 
methods having been tried for purposes of such calendrical adjustments. 
A year occasionally having a thirteenth or additional month which is 
produced of itself is referred to in the Rgveday The Atharvaveda puts it 
more explicitly as ‘He who measures the thirteenth month, fabricated of 
days and nights, having thirty members — against that God, angered, in this 
offence,’<^ In the Black Yajurveda, the thirteenth month is called samsarpa, 
a creeping month, in the Kd(hakay malimiuca, and in the Atharvaveda, 
sanisrasa. From various stray statements in the Brdhmanas, it is possible 
to infer that the Vedic Hindus recognized a lunar year of 354 days 
(12 X 29i), which was adjusted to the sidereal solar year of 366 days {Veddhga 
Jyotisa) either by adding 12 days each year or a thirteenth month of 30 
days every 2\ years. 

Vedic Calendars 

More detailed information as to the various types of years and months, 
calendars built round them and different ways of making luni-solar adjust- 
ments is available in the Niddna Sutra and the Ldfydyana iSrautasutra of 
the Samaveda.^ The following kinds of year are met with in these sutras: 

(a) The Sidereal Lunar Year of 324 days— consists of 12 months 
of 27 days each. 

{b) The Sidereal Lunar Year of 351 days— consists of 13 months 
of 27 days each.

A CX)NCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


(c) The Synodic Lunar Year of 354 days— consists of 6 months 

of 30 days each and 6 months of 29 days each. 

(d) The Civil or Savana Year of 360 days— consists of 12 months 

of 30 days each. 

ie) The Pseudo Solsticial Year— consists of 378 days; here 18 days 
were added to the third year after two civil years of 360 days 
each for bringing about agreement between the civil and the 
sidereal solar year of 366 days. 

Of the above-mentioned years, the sidereal lunar year, the synodic 
lunar year and the savana year were the most important. The first used 
to be adjusted to the civil and the sidereal year through intercalation of 
9 and 15 days respectively, and the second with the sidereal year through 
12 days, for which the dvadasciha period was prescribed. The adjustment 
of the civil year with the sidereal by intercalating 18 days every third year 
has already been mentioned in (e) above. There are also references to 
intercalation with 21 days, which Shamasastry explained as a cycle of 
three savana years of 360 days each, followed by a year of 381 days. Such a 
four-year period contains 1,461 days or four times the Julian year of 365 J 
days. The Taittiriya Samhitd refers to a year of 360 days put in order 
by the sacrifice of five nights, which has been produced as an evidence of 
knowledge in the Brahmana period of a year of 365 or 365J days. But 
scholars are not unanimous in crediting the Hindus of the Brahmana period 
with the knowledge of a year of 365 or 365^ days. A. Berriedale Keith (1) 
has discussed the matter at length. 

Solstices and Equinoxes 

Several passages in the Brdhmanas point unmistakably to the knowledge 
of solstices among the Vedic Hindus. Consider the following passage 
of the Aitareya Brahmana:^ 

‘They perform the ekavinda day, the visuvdn, in the middle of the 
year; by this ekavMa day the gods raised up the sun towards the world 
of heaven (the highest region of the heavens, viz. the zenith). For 
this reason this sun (as raised up) is (called) ekaviniia. Of this 
ekavim^a sun (or the day), the ten days before are ordained for the 
hymns to be chanted during the day; the ten days after are also ordained 
in the same way; in the middle lies the ekavirn§a . . , 

In the Vedic times year-long sacrifices used to be started from the day 
following the winter solstice. The \isuvdn in the middle of the year was 
clearly the summer solstice day. The stationary character of the sun at 
the solstice for 21 days is further to be observed. 

More important was the winter solstice day which marked the beginning 
of the yearly sacrifices and often the beginning of the year and of the yuga.

77 


A reference to this important day is given in the Kausltakl Brdhmana^ 
as follows: 

‘He (the sun) indeed rests on the new moon day of Magha, being 
about to turn towards the north. Thus they rest who are about to 
perform the rites of the prdyanlya atirdtra (the first day on which 
soma is pressed) ... He goes for six months towards the north; they 
follow him with the ascending celebrations of six days each. He hav- 
ing gone six months towards the north stands still, being about to turn 
towards the south. Thus they stop, being about to perform the rites of 
the Vaisuvatlya day. Thus they reach him for the second time. He 
goes six months towards the south. They follow him with the returning 
celebrations of six days each. Having gone six months towards the 
south he stands still, being about to turn towards the north. Thus 
they stop, being about to perform the rites of the Mahdvratlya day. 
Thus they reach him for the third time. Because they reach him three 
times, the year is arranged threefold; for obtaining the year (they do 
thus). About this there is sung a sacrificial stanza: 

‘Arranging the days and nights like a wise spider; 

Six months always towards the south and six months towards the 
north wanders the sun.’ 

The year is thus divided into two halves of six months each marked 
by the winter solstice when the Mahdvrata rites are performed and by the 
summer solstice when the Visuvat day is observed. Moreover, the winter 
solstice fell on the new moon of Magha, that is on the new moon preceding 
the full moon in the naksatra Magha. In the circle of asterisms, the new 
moon of Magha when the sun and the moon are in conjunction clearly falls 
in the naksatra Dhanisfhd or ^ravis(hd (j3 Delphini). This is also borne 
out by the well-known statement of the Veddhga Jyotisa—prapadyetc 
sravisthddau siirydcandramasdvudak — (The sun and the moon turn north 
at the beginning of the naksatra Dhanisfhd). When the winter solstice 
lies in Dhanisfhd and the summer solstice in Maghds (14 naksatras ahead), 
the vernal equinox must lie in the Krttikds. 

Although the equinoxes are not explicitly mentioned in the Brdhmanas, 
the coincidence of the vernal equinox with the Krttikds has been inferred 
from the fact that this naksatra was at the head of the asterisms in the 
time of the Brdhmarias and from the fact that when the vernal equinox 
shifted, through precession, to the naksatra Aivini, the latter became the 
head of the naksatras. The Brdhmanas also contain the important state- 
ment that the Krttikds never deviate from the east, which must have been 
the case when this naksatra marked the intersection of the ecliptic with the 
equator.

LATE VEDIC AND PRE-SIDDHANTIC ASTRONOMY, 
JAINA ASTRONOMY 

In connection with our discussion of astronomical knowledge in the 
Samhitas and the Brahmanas, we have several times referred to the sutras 
and the Veddnga Jyotisa because the latter by and large embodied the 
astronomical knowledge already found in the Vedic period proper. But 
the late character and composition of the sutras and the Jyotisa are not in 
doubt. The Veddhga Jyotisa records the location of the summer and winter 
solstices in the middle of Aslesd and beginning of Dhani^thd. From the 
present positions of the solstices in the asterisms and from the precessional 
rate of 1^ for every 72 years, it is easy to show that at about 1400 b.c. 
the solstices coincided with the middle of A§lesd and the beginning of 
Dhanis{hd, This has led many scholars to suggest 1200 b.c. as the time of 
composition of the Veddfiga Jyotisa. But the possibility of an earlier 
tradition being recorded in the Jyotisa and other internal and literary 
evidence strongly suggest it to be a work of the Sutra period, that is after 
700 or 600 b.c. (Filliozat placed it between 400 b.c. and a.d. 200). The 
work is attributed to Lagadha who probably recast it from an earlier work. 

rilE VtDANGA JYO’llSA 

The Veddnga Jyotisa^ teaches a five-year luni-solar cycle {yuga). 
At the beginning of the cycle, the sun and the moon lie at the starting point 
of the nalqatra Dhanisthd, During this period the sun goes round the 
circle of asterisms 5 limes and the moon 67 times. This means that the 
period has 67 sidereal months and 62 synodic months. Moreover, a solar 
year has 366 sdvana or civil days and the five-year cycle 1,^30 sdvana days. 
A synodic month has 30 lunar days or tithis, so that a five-year cycle has 
1,860 lunar days. These elements give the length of a sidereal month as 
27’31 and that of a synodic month as 29*52 sdvana days. To su mm arize 
these elements, one quinquennial cycle contains 

5 sun’s revolutions; 

67 moon’s sidereal revolutions or months; 

62 moon’s synodic revolutions or months; 

1 ,830 sdvana or civil days; 

1,835 sidereal days; 

1,800 solar days; 

1,860 lunar days or tithis. 

The Jyotisa divides a sdvana day into 30 muhurtaSy 1 muhurta into 
2 nddikds, 1 nddikd into lO^^^) into 124 kd$thas and 1 kd^tha 

into 5 ak^aras. This makes a sdvana day equal 603 kalds and a lunar day 
{tithi) 593 kalds. The duration of a nak^atra is 610 kalds.

The above elements and the measures have been utilized in calculating 
the places in the circle of asterisms where the new and the full moon take 
place during the whole quinquennial cycle. From the explanation given by 
Thibaut, it appears that each nak?atra space (13° 20') was further subdivided 
into 124 parts, and the positions of the new and the full moon were given 
in terms of the naksatra and its subdivisions.® This is a clear indication 
of the scientific use of the stellar zodiac for calculating the positions of the 
sun and the moon.^ 

In the Jyotisa we also find for the first time the rule for determining 
the length of the day between the two solstices. The shortest day is given 
as 12 muhurtas at winter solstice and the longest as 18 muhurtas at summer 
solstice. In one ayana of 183 days, the day length is said to increase or 
decrease by 6 muhurtas , whence the daily increase or decrease works out 
to 6/183 or 2/61 muhurta. 


SOME ANCIENT ASIRONOMERS OF THIS PERIOD 

Varahamihira, in his Brhatsamhita, has recorded the names of a large 
number of astronomers of this period. Some of them are Garga, Para^ara, 
Ka§yapa, Narada, Pitamaha, Surya, Pulisa, Va^istha, Romaka, Vi?nugupta, 
Asita-Devala, ^l§iputra, Bhrgu, Maya, Badarayana, Nagnajit and so on. 
Most of them are mentioned only in name. Passages attributed to some 
of them are quoted particularly by Varaha’s commentator Utpala, but the 
works of the majority of them are no longer extant. The teachings of 
Pitamaha, Surya, Pulisa, Vasistha and Romaka have been summarized by 
Varaha in his Paficasiddhantika about which we shall speak later. Among 
the others, the most important are Garga and Parasara, both of whom 
compiled samhitds known after their names. The astronomical knowledge 
presented in these samhitds is more or less the same as found in the Veddhga 
Jyotisa, It is, therefore, no wonder that Somakara, the commentator of 
the Jyotisa, quotes extensively from Garga in his exposition of the Jyotisa, 

Garga is also important from the viewpoint of his frequent references 
to the Greeks {yamna), and to the excellence of the astronomical science 
as studied among their savants. ‘The Greeks are indeed mlecchas, but 
amongst them this science (astronomy)’, writes Garga, ‘is well established; 
therefore even they are honoured as Iji^isJ From his references to the 
fiercely fighting Greeks who penetrated into the heart of Hindusthan 
(madhyadeia), Kern concluded that Garga lived probably during the period 
of conquests of the Bactrian Greeks (third to second century b.c.). Parasara 
who figures prominently in some of the Furdnas is probably posterior to 
Garga.

A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


JAINA ASTRONOMY 

We have already referred to the Jaina interest in astronomy. Jyotifa 
appears quite early in the history of their religious literature and forms 
an important branch of their study as we know it from the Bhagavati-sutra 
and the Uttaradhyayana-sutra. Santicandragana, in his preface to his 
commentary on the JambudvlpaprajHapti, states that the knowledge of 
astronomy was an indispensable accomplishment on the part of a Jaina 
priest who was to decide the right time and place for religious ceremonies. 
Although the Jainas developed a set of peculiar cosmographical theories 
which came in for sharp criticism at the hands of Brahmana astronomers, 
they adopted and followed, with minor variations, the Brahmanic astronomy 
of the Veddfiga Jyolifa. 

The principal source of Jaina astronomy is SuvycipTajnupti, a work 
divided into 20 books and written in ardhamdgadhi prdkrt, which is extant 
with an elaborate commentary by Malayagiri. Free from Greek influence, 
the work was probably written a few centuries before the Christian era! 
Its authorship has been attributed to Mahavira. The next important 
astronomer was Bhadrabahu (d. 298 b.c.), a srutakeralin and a prominent 
personage in the history of Jaina religion. He is believed to be the author 
of a commentary on the Suryaprajhapti and of an astronomical sanihita 
known after his name, of which only fragments have been preserved in 
later conunentaries. Then we have the Jambudvipaprajnapti with a 
number of commentaries, of much later date, where elaborate descriptions 
of the different dvipas of the Jaina cosmography are met with. 

The peculiarity of the Jaina astronomy consists in its conception of 
two suns, two moons and two sets of 27 mk^atras. This conception is 
a consequence of the Jaina cosmography according to which the earth is 
regarded as a scries of flat concentric rings of land masses separated by 
concentric ocean rings. The central circle Jambudvipa, with the mountain 
Sudarsa Meru in the centre, is encircled by the salt ocean. Beyond it lies 
the Dhdtuki Dvipa encircled by the black ocean Kalodadhi and beyond 
that the Piqkara Dvipa rimmed by an impassable mountain range, the 
Mdnumtara Parvata. The innermost Jambudvipa is divided into ’four 
quarters, of which the southernmost part is Bhdratavarsa (India). The sun, 
the moon and the stars are assumed to move in circles, parallel to the 
earth’s surface, round Mount Meru as centre. As Jaml^dvipa is divided 
into four quarters and four directions, and as the sun should make day 
in succession to the regions south, west, north and east of Meru, the sun’s 
diurnal orbit is also divided into four quarters. Since the length of a day, 
disregarding variations, is 12 hours or 15 muhurtas, the same sun after 
making day over Bhdratavarsa in the southern quarter cannot reappear on 
the following morning as it still has three quarters to travel. To obviate 
this diflSculty, the theory supposes two similar suns, Bhdrata and Airdmia, 
separated from each other by half the orbit, to describe the whole orbit. 
In this process each sun makes day over Bhdratavarsa on alternate days.

This is given in the Suryaprajnapti with Malayagiri’s commentary as 
follows:® 

‘There are two suns, Bharata and Airavata. They both move 
through half a diurnal circle in the course of 30 muhurtas; i.e. in the 
course of 60 muhurtas or 2 days, they complete a full diurnal circle. 
That sun which moves in the outermost circle in the southern hemisphere 
is called Bharata, because it illumines the Bharatakha^ida. The other 
which moves through the same outer circle in the northern hemisphere 
is called Airavata, because it illuminates the Airavata area.’ 

To explain the variations of day length, 183 diurnal circles are imagined. 
Each sun after rising in the first circle rises in the next circle each following 
morning, increasing the day-length in the uttardyana and decreasing it 
in the daksindyana by 6 muhurtas, as taught in the Veddhga Jyotisa. 

For calendrical purposes, the Suryaprajdapti adopts the five-year 
cycle beginning with the summer solstice when the full moon takes place 
at the naksatra Abhijit, Such a five-year cycle or yuga has 1,830 sdvana 
days, 1,800 ‘solar’ days, 1,860 tithis, 60 solar months, 61 sdvana months, 
62 synodic months and 67 sidereal months. Thus a year consists of 366 
sdvana days. The year having 360 solar days is called a rtu year. The 
calendar also recognizes a lunar year of 354 days and a naksatra year 
of 327^1 days, giving the lengths of a synodic and a sidereal month as 
29^1 and 27 days respectively. The year is divided into 2 ayanas of 
183 days each. 

The ecliptic is divided into 28 unequal spaces, beginning with the 
naksatra Abhijit, The scale conforms to the sidereal month-length and 
the circle is divided into 27f^ parts. The Suryaprajnapti contains the 
statement that the planets travel faster than the sun and the stars, the sun 
slower than the moon and the stars faster than the naksatras. Regarding 
the apparently awkward last statement, Kaye thinks that the motion of 
the stars with regard to the fixed naksatras which are here used as a sort 
of zodiacal scale of reference probably means their precession with respect 
to equinoxes.*'

COMMENTARIES OF THE PERIOD 

The first few centuries of the Christian era are very important in the 
history of Hindu astronomy. The inaccuracies and the insuflSciency of 
the Vedic and the Sutraic astronomy must have been felt for a long time. 
The crude calendrical astronomy based on uncorrected motions of the sun 
and the moon against a stellar zodiac had outlived its function and utility.

A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDU 


Accurate study of heavenly bodies, in which the planets were gradually 
to be incorporated, involved the application of more sophisticated mathe- 
matics, adoption of a system of co-ordinates, and more reliable determination 
of their periods of revolution, the sizes of the earth, the relative sizes of 
the sun and the moon, and so on. Although interest in the eclipse phe- 
nomena had been very ancient and recorded at several places in the earliest 
Sarrihitds and the Brahmanas, their calculations and predictions were beyond 
the scope of the kind of astronomy so far practised and taught. All this 
must have occupied the serious attention of the astronomers of this period, 
for by about a.d. 400 or even earlier we for the first time come across aii 
altogether new class of astronomical works called siddhantas dealing with 
matters and methods unknown in the works of any previous period. This 
new class of works is characterized, among others, by the replacement of 
the mk?atra system by the 12 signs of the zodiac, the correct length 
of the year, the correct rules for calculating day-lengths and oblique ascen- 
sions, the determination of mean longitudes by the ahargana method, the 
study of planetary motions by reference to a celestial sphere, the system 
of great and small circles and the geometric models of eccentric circles 
and epicycles, the ideas of parallax and its calculation, and the calculation 
of solar and lunar eclipses. The emphasis on computations also opened 
the way to new methods of analysis. Integral solutions of indeterminate 
equations, rudiments of plane and spherical trigonometry, besides common 
geometrical, arithmetical and algebraic practices, became integral parts 
0 the new science. Increasing mathematization very soon necessitated 
the incorporation of a few chapters on mathematics into most treatises on 
astronomy, and the practice was carried to such an extent that astronomy 
and mathematics became inseparable for several centuries to come

The word siddhdnta means ‘final conclusion’ or ‘solution’. Its

The Paitdmaha-siddhdnta 

This is the most inaccurate of the five siddhdntas noticed. Its astrono- 
mical elements are the same as those of the Veddhga Jyotisa. Thus 
it teaches a quinquennial cycle containing 5 revolutions of the sun, 67 
revolutions of the moon, 60 solar months, 62 synodic months, 2 intercalary 
months, 1,830 sdvana days and 1,860 tithis. The cycle begins with the 
conjunction of the sun and the moon at the first point of the nak?atra 
Dhani^fhd, The rule for the shortest and the longest day is the same as 
that given in the Veddhga Jyoti^a, 

The Vasisfha-siddhdnta 

Although rated inaccurate in the case of its tithis compared to the 
Pauliia, the Romaka and the Surya-siddhdnta^ the teachings of the Va^i^fha- 
siddhdnta were more advanced than those of the Paitdmaha, In this 
system, the traditional naksatras were supplemented with a zodiac with 
its subdivisions of signs, degrees and minutes for the first time. Lagna, 
that is the ecliptic point on the eastern horizon, is mentioned and rough 
rules for finding it from the shadow and vice versa are given. We also 
find rules for determining day-lengths. Rough rules for calculating mean 
longitudes from the length of the midday shadow are given. This 
siddhdnta reveals knowledge of the anomalistic month and gives its values 
as and More importantly, the Vaiisfha-siddhdnta also deals 

with the true motions of the five planets, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars and 
Mercury, and recognizes their motions as direct, stationary {anuvakra), 
retrograde (vakra) and again direct. The synodic periods in days of these 
planets are given as follows: 


Venus 

584-i\ days 

Jupiter 

399-^ days 

Saturn 

378-^^ days 

Mars 

780-5^^ 

Mercury 

115 days 52 nddikds 45 vinddikds 


The siddhdnta also gives the equivalence between synodic and sidereal 
revolutions for each planet, from which the sun’s sidereal revolutions in 
a given number of days, or in other words the length of the solar year, can 
be easily calculated. For Jupiter, the text gives 36 sidereal revolutions as 
equivalent to 391 synodic revolutions. This means that the sun executes 
427 sidereal revolutions during the same time as the Jupiter makes 391 
synodic revolutions, that is in the course of 391 x399 days (omitting I day). 
The length of the solar year, according to the VaM^fha-siddhanta, works 
out to 365-36 days approximately, a considerable improvement upon the 
value adopted in the Veddhga Jyoti^a. At another place,® the siddhdnta 
specifically gives the sidereal year length as 365 J days, as has been shown

by T. S. Kuppanna Sastry. The Vasisfha-siddhanta was recast by Vi§nu- 
candra whose name is mentioned by Brahmagupta and al-BIrunl. 


The Paulisa-siddhanta 

Varaha states that ‘the siddhmta made by Paulina is accurate’. The 
elements of this siddhanta are presented in chapters 3 to 7 and partly in 
chapter 1. These elements include calculation of ahargana, that is the 
number of civil days elapsed from a certain epoch up to a given date, the 
determination from the ahargana of the mean places of the sun and the 
moon and thence their true places. The rules for finding the longitude 
of the moon are analogous to the vakyam method found later on in the 
Tamil astronomy. This siddhanta also contains miscellaneous rules for 
finding direction, place and time, sine tables and simple calculations of 
eclipses. From a statement that there are 43,831 civil days in 120 years, 
the length of the year works out to 365-2583 days. 

The Paulisa-siddhanta, in giving the quantities to be added to or 
subtracted from the mean sun in order to obtain the true places, reveals 
knowledge of the anomaly (kendra) and the equations of the centre. 
According to Thibaut’s interpretation, the rules indicate that for anomalies 

corresponding equations should 
be 21 , 96 , 139', 140', 108' and 50'. But how the equations are obtained 
IS not mentioned; that is there is no hint as to any epicyclic or eccentric 
model upon which to calculate them.® 

The sine table given in chapter 4 may be due to Paulina or may be 
a common feature of all the three accurate siddhdntas. The radius adopted 
for calculating the table is 120' and not 3438’ used in later astronomical 
texts. There is also evidence of the beginnings of spherical trigonometry 
the* formula given for the variation of day-length takes 

R sin (ascensional difference) = /? tan ^ tan 8 
where 4 , = latitude and 8 = the sun’s declination. 

Pauhia s calculations of lunar and solar eclipses are rough and less 

‘ Surya-sidJsnta. The 

^ moon’s nodes is given as 6794-6854, 

the semi-diameter of the moon as 17' and that of the sun as 16-8'. The

Al-Birflnl, who derived his information on Hindu astronomy both 
from this siddhanta as summarized by Varaha as also from Brahmagupta’s 
BrQhmasphuta-siddhdnta, expressed the view that its author Paulina was a 
Greek from the city of Saintra which he supposed to be Alexandria.^ 
Besides Varaha’s summary of the PaulUa-siddhdnta, references to, and ele- 
ments from, a Paulisa-siddhdnta were given by Bhattotpala and Pfthudaka- 
svamin. These elements differ from Varaha’s Paulina and agree more 
closely with those found in the Saura of the Paflcasiddhantika and in 
Aryabhata’s ardhardtrika system. Possibly the original work known to 
Varahamihira underwent one or several emendations with the passage 
of time. 

The Romaka-siddhdnta 

The elements of the Romaka-siddhdnta are summarized partly in 
chapter 1 where matters concerning yuga^ ahargana, intercalation of lunar 
months and such general topics are discussed and in chapter 8 dealing 
with eclipse calculations. The title suggests its foreign origin which is 
further supported by its astronomical elements and the year being tropical. 
It introduces a luni-solar cycle of 2,850 years containing 1,050 intercalary 
months and 16,547 omitted lunar days. The total number of synodic 
months in this period will be 2,850 x 12-|-1,050 or 35,250; the total number 
of civil days will be 35,250x30—16,547 or 1,040,953. The lengths of 
the year and the synodic month calculated from these elements compare 
favourably with those given by Hipparchus and Ptolemy as follows: 

Romaka-siddhdnta Hipparchus-Ptolemy 

Year . , 365 days 5 h 55' 12" 365 days 5 h 55' 15-8" 

Synodic month . . 29 days 12 h 44' 2-2" 29 days 12 h 44' 2-5" 

The anomalistic month is given as 3031/110 days or 27-554 days. This 
makes the moon’s daily motion in anomaly as 13° 3' 53" 58^^^ 55^^ 5F 
45^^ in close agreement with Ptolemy’s 13° 3' 53" 56^“ 29^^ 38^ 38^^ in 
sexagesimal units. 

It is to be noted that the total number of years and synodic months 
in the luni-solar cycle used in the Romaka-siddhdnta are both divisible by 
150. The result of this reduction is that 19 solar years comprise 235 
synodic months. This is the well-known 19-year cycle of Meton, the 
Athenian astronomer (432 b.c.). The reason for multiplying Meton’s cycle 
by a factor of 150 was probably to arrive at a yuga containing a whole 
number of civil days in conformity with the established Hindu practice. 

The information given in the Romaka-siddhdnta regarding the equations 
of centre for the sun and the moon is more detailed, but again without 
any indication as to how these corrections were obtained. In finding 
the anomaly, that is the dijfference between the longitude of the mean

sun and that of the apogee, the longitude of the apogee is stated as 75® 
as against Ptolemy’s value of 65° 30'. The following equations of centre 
of the sun and the moon for their anomalies at intervals of 15° are given 
(Table 2.2).

For purposes of comparison, a few values given by Ptolemy are quoted. 
The equations for the sun agree very closely, but this is not so for those 
for the moon. The text gives latitudes of the moon, parallaxes in longitudes 
and latitudes and a few other details. 

At one time Srisena appeared to be the author of the original Romaka- 
siddhdnta. Brahmagupta himself, in his Brahmasphuta-siddhanta, refers 
to Srisena as the author of the work. From a more careful study of the 
passage, Thibaut showed that Srlsena was at best a poor compiler who 
possibly worked on the original Romaka-siddhanta and incorporated into 
it planetary elements from other authorities, namely Lata, Vijayanandin 
and Aryabhata I. In fact, Brahmagupta also severely criticized Srisena’s 
effort and passed the remark that he had turned a heap of jewels, which 
the original Romaka-siddhdnta was, into a patched rag. In this connection, 
the name of Lata is important, for Varaha himself referred to Lata as a 
commentator of the Romaka-siddhmta and Brahmagupta held him in 
respect. 

The Surya-siddhdnta 

The Surya-siddhdntQy also called the Saura-siddhanta, was according to 
Varahamihira the most accurate of the five siddhantas. The main features 
of this work summarized in the Pahcasiddhdntikd appear in chapters 
9-11, 16 and 17; the yuga elements of the sun and the moon are given in 
chapter 1. 14; chapters 13 to 15 discuss some of its general matters, e.g. 
cosmogony, geography, etc. In the history of Hindu astronomy, the 
Surya-siddhanta occupies a very important position in that it does not 
appear to be the work of a single individual, but underwent periodic revi- 
sions and served as a standard astronomical text in different periods of

time. Thibaut called Varaha’s summary the old version of the siddhanta 
to distinguish it from the modem version we now possess. P. C. Sengupta 
has shown that there was certainly an old Surya-siddhdnta dated about 
A.D. 400, which was brought up to date by Varaha himself on the basis 
of Aryabhata’s ardharatrika (midnight) system; and that the modem 
Surya-siddhanta, with additions of improved data from Brahmagupta and 
others, continued to develop till the twelfth century a.d. or even later. 

Coming to Varaha’s version, the siddhanta taught that 180,000 years 
contained 66,389 intercalary months and 1,045,095 omitted lunar days. 
This gives 65,746,575 days in the yuga thus conceived. For the sake of 
comparison with the elements given in the modern Surya-siddhanta, the 
period of 180,000 years can be converted to a mahdyuga of 4,320,000 years 
by multiplying the former by 24 and the total number of days in such a 
period worked out. The mean motions of planets are given in chapter 16. 
The integral numbers of revolutions performed by the planets in a mahdyuga 
can be easily calculated, and they are set down in Table 2.3. The values

It will be seen that the planetary revolution numbers in a mahdyuga, 
as given in the drdhardtrika system of Aryabhata I and in the old Surya- 
siddhanta summarized by Varaha, are the same, but these elements and 
other astronomical constants differ in several cases from those of the modem 
SUrya-siddhdnta. This identity of astronomical elements in the old Surya- 
siddhdnta with those of Aryabhata’s drdhardtrika system has given rise to 
the view that the former might have been recast by Varaha after the teachings 
of his older contemporary Aryabhata L

A CX)NCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


Afahdyuga 

The concept of mahdyuga is the central feature of the Indian astrono- 
mical siddhantas. It developed from the idea of yuga or cycle which is 
very old indeed and is met with in the Brdhmana literature. It is a period 
at the beginning of which all planetary bodies are in conjunction, during 
which they all perform integral numbers of revolutions, and at the end 
of which, therefore, they are again in conjunction. In selecting the length 
of such a cycle, care was taken that the apsides and the nodes also have 
whole numbers of revolutions. The mahayuga of 4,320,000 years is such 
a period, Biot demonstrated that the length of the year as 365 days 
6 h 12' 35-56" is such that the least number of years containing a whole 
number of civil days is 1,080,000. The mahdyuga also called the caturyuga 
is just 4 times this number. The number 108 is again 4 times 27, the 
number of naksatras. 

According to Aryabhata I, a mahdyuga (simply called a yuga) is 
divided into four equal parts or yugapddas, each consisting of 1,080,(X)0 
years. In the modern Surya-siddhdnta, a mahdyuga is subdivided into 
four mundane ages, e.g. the Krta or Golden Age, the Tretd or Silver Age, 
the Dvdpara or the Brazen Age and the Kali or the Iron Age.“ The dura- 
tions of these ages are in the descending order of 4, 3, 2 and 1 and have 
the following solar years: 


The Krta 
The Tretd 
The Dvdpara 
The Kali 


1.728.000 solar years 

1.296.000 

864.000 

432.000 


These divisions are in keeping with the traditions of the Smrti and the 
Purdnas. Their use in an astronomical siddhdnta is met with for the first time 
in the works of Brahmagupta, from which it might have been incorporated 
in the modern Surya-siddhanta by its unknown redactor. A special impor- 
tance attaches to the Kali or the current Iron Age through which we are 
at present passing. At the commencement of this epoch, the planets are 
assumed to be in conjunction for the last time at the initial point of the 
Hindu sphere. As all astronomical data and calculations given in the 
Surya-siddhanta and works following more or less the same system depend 
on this assumption, it is important to know its date. This epoch started 
at midnight at the meridian of Ujjayini between February 17 and 18, 
3102 B.C. 

Revolutions of the apogees of the sun and the planets are not recognized 
in Varaha’s version of the Surya-siddhdnta although it is a characteristic 
feature of the modern Surya-siddhdnta and other later astronomical texts. 
The ahargana method of finding the mean longitudes of the sun, the moon 
and the planets is the same as that found in the modern version.

The old Surya-siddhanta, like the modern, makes use of an epicyclic 
model for calculating the true planetary positions. This and other geo- 
metric models as used by the Hindus will be explained in what follows. For 
such calculations, the important elements are the longitudes of the apogees 
and the dimensions of epicycles for the manda (equation of centre) and 
the iighra (equation of conjunction) corrections. Table 2.4 gives these 
elements in the old and the modern Surya-siddhanta.

The difference in the values of the above elements clearly points to 
the modifications introduced into this standard text since the days of 
Varahamihira. In the old Surya-siddhanta, the dimensions of the epicycles 
were assumed to remain constant over odd and even quadrants; in the 
modern version, presumably following Aryabhata I and others, epicycles 
have been made to vary between odd and even quadrants. The formula 
for determining the manda correction, i.e. the equation of centre, is given

These rules, in their essential features, are in agreement with those found 
in the modern Surya-siddhdnta. P. C. Sengupta attempted to show that 
Varaha, in preparing his version of the old Surya-siddhdnta, borrowed 
the epicyclic method of calculating the equations of centre and argument 
from Aryabhata J.® 

The old Surya-siddhdnta gives rules for calculations of the solar and 
lunar eclipses which have been carried forward in the modern version 
with further details. 

The old Surya-siddhdnta, even after its modernization after the works 
of Aryabhata I and Brahmagupta, continued to be in use in dilferent parts 
of the country. In the beginning of the ninth century, the Nepalese astrono- 
mer Sumati wrote a karana, whose elements were based on the old Surya- 
siddhdnta. Satananda’s calendrical work Bhdsvati (eleventh century a.d.) 
also utilized this work to a great extent.*^ 

The Modern Surya-siddhdnta 

It would have perhaps been proper to deal with the modern Siirya- 
siddhdnta later on after noticing the works of Aryabhata I, Bhaskara I, 
Brahmagupta, Manjulacarya and others inasmuch as the form in which 
we now have it developed out of the efforts of these distinguished astrono- 
mers. But, after having started with the old version and made frequent 
references to some of the elements in which it differed from the modern, 
a few remarks about the modern version here would appear more preferable. 
To emphasize its high antiquity, the text opens with the statement that 
the knowledge of astronomy presented therein was revealed to an asura 
called Maya by the sun god himself. The mention of Maya at one time 
led to much speculation. Observing that the name of the Egyptian king, 
Ptolemaios, appeared as Turamaya in Indian inscriptions, Weber conjec- 
tured that asura Maya might be the altered name of the celebrated Greek 
astronomer Ptolemy himself. Such conjectures are no longer held seriously 
even in the background of unmistakable influence of Greek astronomy 
(possibly pre-Ptolemaic) on Hindu astronomy of the siddhdntic period. 
According to al-BIrunI, the Surya-siddhdnta was composed by Lafa, a 
contemporary of Aryabhata I. Possibly Lata composed a commentary 
on it. 

The work is divided into 14 chapters, e.g. (i) Mean motions of the 
planets (madhyarnddhikdra), (ii) True places of the planets {spastddhikdra), 
(iii) Detemunation of direction, place and time (tripra^nddhikdra), (iv) Lunar 
eclipse (candragrahanadhikdra), (v) Solar eclipse {suryagrahanddhikdra\ 
parallax, (vi) Projection of eclipses {chedyakddhikdra\ (vii) Planetary

conjunctions {grahayutyadhikdra\ (viii) Conjunction of planets 
junction-stars of nak?atras (fiaksatragrahayutyadhikdra\ (ix) Heliacal risings 
and settings of planets {udayastadhikara), (x) Moon’s risings and settings 
and the elevation of the moon’s horns (srngomatyadhikdra), (xi) Phenomena 
called pdta (pdtadhikdra), (xii) Cosmogony and geography {bhugolddhydya), 
(xiii) Astronomical instruments (jyotisopanisadadhydya) and (xiv) Reckoning 
of time (mdnddhydya). The text is highly condensed and written in a 
manner which gives the impression that its main purpose was not to teach 
and explain the principles of astronomy, but to provide a set of rules for 
memorization. In this the Surya-siddhanta was no exception as most 
Hindu astronomical texts were really compendiums of astronomical rules, 
the task of exposition being left to the teachers and the commentators. 
As to brevity and condensation, the work covered the subject in 500 verses 
whereas the Brahmasphufa-siddhanta needed 1,008 verses, Sripati’s Siddhanta- 
kkhara 890 verses and Bhaskara IPs Siddhdnta-siromani 962 verses. Even 
then the text is far less cryptic and condensed than the Aryabhaffya which 
attempted to present its system in 120 verses, including the 33 stanzas 
on mathematics and the 10 glti stanzas. 

The mahdyuga system and the theories of planetary motions have already 
been referred to in our discussion of the old Surya-siddhanta. Regard- 
ing planetary motions, the modern version, interestingly enough, contains 
an account which appears to have been developed before the epicyclic 
theory found general acceptance. According to this, the planets are 
attached, by cords of air, to invisible beings called forms of time which 
are stationed at the uccas {mandocca and kghrocca) and the pdtas (nodes). 
The planets are impelled in their motions by the provector wind (pravdhavdta) 
uniformly, but the invisible gods at the uccas pull or push them in such a 
way that their motions appear variable. 

Special mention should be made of the treatment of the precession 
of equinoxes, which is missing from its earlier version. The precessional 
rate and the rules of correcting the longitudes by taking account of it are 
given in chapter 3, verses 9-12. From the fact that these rules do not 
appear in their proper context either in chapter I or II where methods 
of finding mean and true planetary motions are discussed, but are surrep- 
titiously introduced where these are least expected, Burgess concluded that 
these were interpolations found necessary as a result of afterthought.® 
As we shall see later, two theories regarding precessional motion were 
propounded by different schools of Hindu astronomers. The first and 
the more ancient view is the theory of libration or oscillation of the 
equinoxes about a fixed point. In this theory the equinoxes, like the 
swing of a pendulum, at first move eastward, reach the maximum amplitude 
and then move westward. The number of oscillations executed in 
a mahdyuga is given as 600 making the time period 7,200 years. The 
maximum eastward or westward deviations from the fixed point are set 


* See Burgess* notes to his translation of S&SL, iii. 9-12. 



92

down differently by different authorities, accounting for differences in the 
annual precessional rates. The Surya-siddhdnta has adopted this libration 
theory and given the maximum eastward or westward deviation as 27 
whence the annual precessional rate works out to 54 as against the modem 
value of 50-25''. A similar libration theory is met with in the Soma-, 
Sdkalya- and Laghu Vmstha-siddhanta. The other theory is that of a 
complete revolution of the equinoxes through the circle of asterisms, 
propounded for the first time in India by Mahjulacarya (a.d. 932) and 
clearly explained by Bhaskara 11. Manjula states that the equinoxes 
revolve 199,669 times in a kalpa (that is 1,000 mahdyugas), whence the 
period of one revolution works out to 21,635-8073 years and the annual 
precessional rate 59-9". 

The Surya-siddhdnta in its modern form enjoyed great popularity for 
several centuries. This is attested by a large number of commentaries 
written by able astronomers and by the richness of the manuscript materials 
available in the libraries of India and abroad.® Some of the commentators 
include Bhattotpala (a.d. 966), Cande^vara and Mallikarjuna Suri (both 
twelfth century a.d.), Paramesvara (a.d. 1432), Yallaya (a.d. 1472), 
BhOdhara (a.d. 1572), Nrsirpha Daivajna (a.d. 1586), Rahganatha 
(a.d, 1603), Kamalakara (a.d. 1618), Visvanatha (a.d. 1628) and Dadabhai 
(a.d. 1719). Besides these, there exist several anonymous commentaries 
as well as astronomical tracts based on the rules of this great siddhdnta. 

LEADING ASTRONOMERS OF THE PERIOD 

Aryabhafa I {b. a.d. 476) 

The importance of Aryabhata lies in the fact that he probably was in 
the vanguard of the new astronomical movement which resulted in the 
recasting of this new branch of knowledge about the fifth century a.d. 
Piecemeal efforts might have started earlier as is evident from Varaha- 
raihira’s account of the five siddhantas, and before and about the time when 
Aryabhata flourished there were certainly astronomers of repute who were 
variously engaged in reforming astronomy, but little is known about their 
contributions as their works have not survived. As matters stand, the 
Aryabhafiya is the earliest preserved astronomical text bearing the name of 
an individual of the scientific period of Indian astronomy. Moreover, 
his place at the head of this movement is assured by the great influence 
his works and teachings wielded among astronomers of subsequent ages, 
and by the existence of a long line of followers who propagated his views 
through excellent commentaries. 

From his Aryabhafiya,^ we learn that he was 23 years of age in a.d. 
499 when he wrote his famous work, which gives a.d. 476 as the year of 
his birth. From another statement of his® that he sets forth in his work the 
science which is held in high esteem at Kusumapura (a place near modem

Patna), scholars have thought for a long time that Aryabhata was either 
born in Kusumapura or lived and taught in that great city of ancient India. 
Such a view now appears untenable in the light of recent studies on the 
works of Bhaskara I and his commentators and also of the medieval 
commentators of Aryabhata. In these works, Aryabhata is frequently 
referred to as an dsmaka, that is one belonging to the Asmaka country 
which is the name of a country in the south, possibly Kerala. His 
work is sometimes designated as Asmaka-sphufa-tantra. These findings 
coupled with the fact that commentaries of, and works based on, Arya- 
bhaflya have come largely from South India, from Kerala in particular, 
certainly constitute a strong argument in favour of Kerala being the main 
place of his life and activity. 

Aryabhata’s mathematical-astronomical masterpiece, the Aryabhailya, 
is composed in four sections, e.g. Gltikdpada, Ganitapada, Kalakriydpada 
and Golapdda. Of these the Ganitapdda deals exclusively with mathematics 
and the Dasagltikd deals, among others, with an alphabetical system of 
expressing numbers, which will be considered under mathematics in a 
separate chapter. The astronomical elements and parameters are given 
in the Dasagltikd in his novel alphabetical system. The two remaining 
sections, the Kdlakriyd and the Gola^ deal with astronomical principles and 
methods of computation in a highly condensed form. Kdlakriyd means 
the reckoning of time, and as such we find in this section a discussion of 
such topics as the division of time and the circle, definitions of solar year, 
lunar month, civil day, sidereal day, intercalary months, omitted lunar 
days, planetary orders and movements, the eccentric-epicyclic models, 
use of these models for the calculations of true planetary positions, calcu- 
lation of true distances of planets from the earth and related matters. Thus 
this section deals more or less with such topics as we find discussed under 
chapters called madhyamadhikdra and spa^fddhikdra of later astronomical 
texts. Aryabhata does not give methods for the ahargana for calculating 
the mean longitudes of planets, the knowledge of which he possibly took 
for granted. His treatment of the eccentric-epicyclic model is important, 
for it appears possible that Varahamihira might have adopted it in recasting 
the older Surya-siddhdnta in the form given in his Pahcasiddhdntikd, In 
this model, Aryabhata used the hypotenuse in calculating the equation of 
the centre as also for the conjunction correction. This was followed up 
by astronomers of his school. But Brahmagupta and others used the 
hypotenuse for the conjunction correction and the radius as an approxi- 
mation for calciilating the equation of the centre. 

The last section Gola means the sphere. Here the methods of repre- 
senting planetary motions in a celestial sphere are explained and such terms 
as prime vertical, meridian, horizon, hour circle, equator, ecliptic, etc., are 
defined. The sun, the nodes of the moon and planets and the earth’s 
shadow move along the ecliptic which is inclined to the equator at an angle 
of 24°. The rotation of the earth about its axis is given as an explanation 
for the apparent westward motion of the stationary asterisms, through 



94 


A CONCISE mSTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


the well-known simile of a man in a moving boat, to whom a fixed object 
appears to move in the opposite direction. Aryabhata was the first among 
the Indian astronomers to have mentioned the rotation of the earth to explain 
the apparent daily motions of the fixed stars, although he was in this opposed 
and even bitterly criticized by later astronomers. His followers, however 
explained the verse in the usual sense. The diurnal rotation of the earth 
was known to the Greeks several centuries earlier, for in the fourth century 
B.c. Heraclides of Pontus and his contemporary Ecphantus had clearly 
held this view. Other topics discussed in the Gola include parallax, the 
eclipses and related matters. Thus in the Gola are compressed a set of 
rules which usually find their treatment in chapters called triprasnadhikara, 
candragrahanadhikara and suryagrahanadhikara of later siddhantas. 

The system of astronomy taught in the Aryabhafiya is sometimes caUed 
the audayika inasmuch as the day beginning is reckoned from sunrise 
at Lanka. From Varahamihira, Brahmagupta and others we learn that 
Aryabhata was the originator of another, the ardharatrika system, in which 
the day is reckoned from midnight at Lanka. Varaha’s statement on 
this is as follows; ‘Aryabhata maintains that the beginning of the day is 
to be reckoned from midnight at Lanka; and the same teacher again says 
that the day begins from sunrise at Lanka.’ Brahmagupta, in his 
Brahmasphuta-siddhanta, also mentions Aryabhata as the author of the 
sunrise and the midnight systems and himself Mowed the latter, along 
with its astronomical elements, in writing his Khandakhadyaka. ’ Thus 
although a great critic of Aryabhata, Brahmagupta himself preserved for 
posterity his rival’s ardharatrika system. Al-BirunI mentions that Aryabhata 
also wrote a tantra, but this work has not come down to us. It is possible 
that the same Aryabhafiya was meant as it also came to be known as a 
tantra (BhSskara 1). 


Of the direct pupils of Aryabhata, the names of Paijdurangasvaml 
Lafadeva, PrabhSkara and NiljSanku are mentioned by Bhaskara I Lata- 
deva^ the expounder of the old Romaka- and Surya-siddhanta, earned the 
appellauon ' sarvasiddhanta-guru' and was held in high esteem by Varaha 
But ^e man who appears to have contributed most to the propagation of 
Aryabhatas astronomy, both through commentaries and independent 
works based on his master’s principles and parameters, was Bhaskara I 
a contemporary of Brahmagupta and himself an accompUshed astronomer’ 
In the eighth century LaUa wrote a work based on the Aryabhafiya. Some 
of the medieval commentators include Bhutavi 5 riu, Nilakaptha Somasutvan 
Parame^vara, SOryadeva and Yallaya. * 


Varahamihira (c. a.d. 505) 

The author of the Pahcasiddhantika we have discussed above appears 
jre as a wmpder and a historian of astronomy than as an astron^r 
of ongmahty. Nevertheless such a compiler could be an astronomer of 
no mean order He was, however, more weU known as an astrologer and 
wrote compendious astrological treatises such as BrhatsatjMtd, Brh^taka 



ASTRONOMY 


95 


Laghujdtaka and Yogayatra. According to Bhattotpala, Varaha had 
originally belonged to Magadha and later on lived and worked in uyayim. 
He flourished in the middle of the sixth century a.d. His astrology and 
hordidstra (horoscopes) were of Greek origin, and it is therefore not 
surprising that his works abound in Greek technical terms. 

Bhdskara I (c. a.d. 600) 

The greatest exponent of Aryabhata’s system of astronomy, Bhaskara I 
was a contemporary of Brahmagupta. T. S. Kuppanna Sastri placed him 
between a.d. 550 and 628. Shukla showed that he lived beyond this limit, 
his commentary on the Aryabhafiya being written in a.d. 629. Stray refer- 
ences to his works appear to indicate his association with Sura^tra (Western 
India) and A^maka (South India, possibly Kerala). It is possible that he 
was a native of either of these two regions and migrated to the other. 

Bhaskara I wrote three works, e.g. the Mahdbhdskarlya, the Laghubhds- 
kariya and a bhdsya on the Aryabhaflya, The Mahdbhdskariya is an 
elaborate exposition of the three astronomical chapters of the Aryabhafiya, 
arranged in eight chapters devoted to the following topics: (1) Mean longi- 
tude of planets and indeterminate analysis (kuffaka); (2) Longitude correc- 
tion; (3) Time, place and direction, spherical trigonometry, latitudes and 
longitudes of junction-stars; (4) True longitudes of planets; (5) Solar and 
lunar eclipses; (6) Rising, setting and conjunction of planets; (7) Astrono- 
mical constants; and (8) tithi and miscellaneous examples. The work is 
occasionally characterized by innovations and the author’s own methods. 
For example, to find the mean longitudes of planets, the sighra of venus 
and mercury and the perigee and node of the moon, Bhaskara I gives a 
new method called the pratyabda-sodhana. It is true Aryabhata gave rules 
for indeterminate analysis {kut(aka), but it was the unquestionable merit 
of Bhaskara I to fully explain the method and its application to astronomy. 
In his formula for the equation of the centre, he uses manda karna or 
hypotenuse to obtain the correction more accurately, whereas other Indian 
astronomers remained generally satisfied with the approximate value due 
to the use of the radius only. 

The Laghubhdskarlyaj as the name implies, is an abridged version 
of the author’s fuller work noticed above. Intended for the beginner, its 
treatment is more systematic. His Bhdsya is an elaborate and at the same 
time a learned commentary on the Aryabhaftya and abounds in quotations 
from Vydkaranay Veddnta, Mimdrpsdy Artha^dstra, Manusmrti and similar 
texts. The great popularity of Bhaskara’s works, particularly in the south, 
is attested by several extant commentaries, of which mention should be 
made of those by Govindasvamin (c, 80Q-850), SankaranarSyaija (c. 825-875), 
Udayadivakara {c. 1073) and Parame^vara (c. 1360-1460). 

Brahmagtqfta (c. a.d. 598) 

In his Brdhmasphuta-siddhdnta, Brahmagupta states that he was the 
son of Ji§i?ugupta, lived in the reign of King Vyaghramukha, and composed 



96 


A rONCISr HISTORY or sriFNCL IN INDIA 


this astronomical work in saka 550 (a.d. 628) at the age of 30. According 
to al-BJruni, Brahmagupta was from Bhillamala, a town between Multan 
and Ahilwara. Biihlcr identified Bhillamala with modern Bhinmal or Primal 
near the northern frontier of Gujarat. 

The Brahmasphufa-siddhanta is a voluminous work comprising 1,008 
verses (or 1,022 verses if the last chapter on generalities is included) and 
divided into 24 chapters. The main astronomical topics are dealt with 
in the first 10 chapters in the following order: mean planetary motions, 
true planetary motions, problems of time, space and distance, lunar and 
solar eclipses, risings and settings of planets, the moon’s cusps and shadows, 
conjunctions of planets. Some of these topics are further discussed in 
chapters 13-17, 19-21. Chapter 22 is devoted to astronomical instruments. 
Chapters 12 and 18 deal with mathematics and reveal Brahmagupta’s 
excellence and originality as a mathematician. 

The chapter 11, entitled Tantra-panksadhyaya (examination of other 
astronomical .systems), is full of historical importance. Fully conscious 
of his own abilities, Brahmagupta criticized the views of, and rules and 
methods given by, other astronomers, notably Aryabhata I, ^rlsena, Vi§nu- 
candra, Lata and Pradyumna. He was also very critical of foreign astrono- 
mical concepts and elements which by then had found their way into Indian 
astronomical works. He rejected the five-year yuga system of the Vedanga 
Jyoti^a and criticized the absurd views of the Jainas who believed in the 
two suns and moons and two sets of nak^atras. His undue bitterness 
towards Aryabhata did not fail to attract the notice of al-Birunl who, 
in spite of his regard for Brahmagupta, freely acknowledged the merit of 
Aryabhata and his school. Brahmagupta attacked Aryabhata for dividing 
the yuga into four equal parts, for upholding the rotatory motion of the earth, 
for believing in the eclipses being caused by the shadows of the moon and 
the earth and not in accordance with the traditional Rdhu-Ketu theory. 
All this is understandable if we remember that he followed in the main 
the Brahma-siddhdnta and wrote his work at the age of 30 when he was 
certainly an enthusiastic supporter of the orthodox view. 

From this position he certainly travelled a long way when he composed 
at the age of 67 his Khandakhadyaka, based principally on Aryabhata’s 
ardharatrika system. Compared to his earlier work it is a small tract in eight 
chapters, to which a small appendix {Uttara Khandakhadyaka) is added. 
Here the mathematical chapters are omitted and purely astronomical topics 
are dealt with in the following order: tithis and nak^atras; mean and true 
places; time, space and direction; lunar and solar eclipses; rising and setting 
of planets; the moon’s cusps; conjunction of planets. Although he 
reconciled himself, by and large, to Aryabhata’s system, he nevertheless 
followed his own rules in a number of cases, which he considered to provide 
better and more accurate results. He gave methods for finding the instan- 
taneous daily motion of planets affected by manda and iighra inequalities, 
correct equations for parallax in longitude and latitude, correct equations

for drkkarma and better expressions for valana. In all this a better 
mathematician was obviously at work. 

Brahmagupta’s works played an important part in the introduc- 
tion among the Arabs of a new mathematics-based astronomy. Both 
Brahmasphuta-siddhanta and Khandakhddyaka were translated into Arabic, 
with the assistance of Hindu pandits, by Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Fazarl 
(d. 796 or 800) and Ya’qub ibn Jariq (d. 796) under the Arabic titles of 
Sindhind and Arkand respectively. These early Arabic translations were 
defective and corrupt, but none the less exerted a great influence among the 
Arab scholars. Indian commentators of Brahmagupta include Prthudaka- 
svaml, Amaraja, Bhattotpala, Lalla, Somesvara, Sridatta and Varupa. 
Pfthudakasvami commented on both the works, whereas the rest concen- 
trated on his Khandakhddyaka only, which incidentally proves its greater 
popularity. 

Vatesvara (b. a.d. 880), Manjuldcdrya {c. a.d. 932), Aryabhata II (c, a.d. 950), 
Sripati (c. a.d. 999), &atdnanda (c. eleventh century) 

Several astronomers flourished between the time of Brahmagupta and 
Bhaskara II (twelfth century), who made varying contributions to the subject. 
Of them mention may be made of Va^e^vara, Manjulacarya (also called 
Muhjala), Aryabhata II, Sripati and Satananda. Vate^vara’s importance 
lies mainly in his criticism of Brahmagupta. A follower of Aryabhata’s 
system, he attacked Brahmagupta in the same manner as the latter had 
attacked his master about 250 years before. The chapter 10 of section 1 
of his Vatesvara-siddhdnta is devoted exclusively to criticizing and refuting 
the views of Brahmagupta. The book is written in three principal sections, 
e.g, mean motions, true motions and problems of time, space and distance, 
each divided into a number of chapters. From his own statement we learn 
that he was the son of Mahadatta Bhatta, a native of Anandapura in the 
Panjab, and was bom in §aka 802. Author of Laghumdnasa in six chapters, 
Manjulacarya introduced into Indian astronomy the corrections due to the 
precession of the equinoxes. This precession is in the sense of retrograde 
motion and not of oscillation, as we have already noticed. The author of 
one Arya-siddhanta or Maha-siddhdnta calls himself Aryabhata who flourished 
about the middle of the tenth century. The work is composed in 18 chapters 
and devoted to familiar astronomical topics. It has a special chapter 
on kutfaka, i.e. integral solutions of indeterminate equations of the first 
degree. Aryabhata n was a compiler and did not possess the merit of 
his illustrious predecessors. He did not also follow Aryabhata I, but 
adhered instead to the orthodox views. He mentioned the precession of 
the equinoxes. Sripati, son of Nagadeva, is well known for his Dhikofi, 
a karana work based on the Aryabhaflya, a fuller astronomical work 
Siddhdnta-iekhara divided into 20 chapters and his Ganitatilaka, a work 
on mathematics. iSrlpati considered, among other things, the moon’s 
second inequality. Satananda flourished in the eleventh century in Puri

on the coast of the Bay of Bengal. His Bhdsvatl was composed more or 
less in imitation of the Surya-siddhdnta and attained a measure of popularity 
among the almanac-makers. Bhdsvati is a karai^a work. 

Bhdskara II {b. a.d. 1 1 14) 

Bhaskaracarya or Bhaskara II, to distinguish him from his namesake 
of the sixth/seventh century, was born in a.d. 1 1 14 in Vijapur in the province 
of Karnata on the Western Ghats. His Siddhdnta-^iromani written in 
A.D. 1150 when he was 36 readily surpassed similar efforts by his pre- 
decessors in the field of astronomy and mathematics in lucidity of exposi- 
tion, depth of treatment and occasional flashes of originality. The work is 
arranged in four parts, of which the first two, the LJldvatl and the Bljaganita, 
deal with arithmetic and algebra respectively. Astronomy proper is 
treated in the two remaining sections, e.g. the Ganitadhydya and the 
Golddhydya. In the former section, the mean and the true motions of 
planets, the three problems relating to time, direction and place, the eclipses, 
risings, settings and the conjunctions of planets, etc., are treated in the same 
sequence as met with in the Surya-siddhanta. The Golddhydya^ or the 
chapter on the sphere where the same problems reappear, is more important 
from the viewpoint of theoretical astronomy. The epicyclic-eccentric 
theories to account for planetary motions are fully developed. The astrono- 
mical instruments described in the Yantrddhydya are more numerous and 
perfect than those given in the Surya-siddhdnta and other works. 

Sufficiently clear and detailed as his versified rules were, Bhaskara II 
wrote his own commentary Vdsandbhdsya to further explain and illustrate 
his own rules wherever he thought necessary. In a.d. 1183, he wrote 
another work on planetary motions under the title Karamkutuhala. His 
works, both in their entirety and in parts, are available in a large number 
of manuscripts. Several commentaries were also produced later on by 
such medieval astronomers as Ganesa, Laksmidasa, Mumsvara, Nrsiipha, 
Rahganatha, Visvanatha and others, which kept alive Bhaskara IPs 
popularity for several centuries throughout the length and breadth of India. 

SECONDARY WORKS AND COMMENTARIES 

The Sanskrit astronomical literature of the medieval period is extremely 
rich in secondary works and commentaries. The majority of this class of 
literature, it is true, was produced after Bhaskara II particularly from the 
fourteenth or fifteenth century, but it is highly unrealistic to draw any 
such line of demarcation. It is not quite true that the astronomical literature 
produced after Bhaskara II was barren of originality. As we have seen, some 
of the original authors before the twelfth century appeared as excellent com- 
mentators. Bhaskara I himself spent much of his time in elucidating his 
master Aryabhata’s works. In the ninth century a.d. we have Brahmagupta’s 
scholiast PfthudakasvSmI (c. 864) who wrote two important commentaries, 
Brdhmasiddhdnta-vdsandbhd^ya and Kharidakhddyaka'Vivara^, In the same

century Govindasvami (c, 800-850) and his pupil ^ahkaranarayana, of 
the Aryabhata school in the south, elucidated the works of Bhaskara L 
The former, in addition to his Mahdbhdskariya-bha^ya, wrote a few other 
astrological tracts, whereas the latter commented upon the Laghubhdskanya, 
At the beginning of the thirteenth century Amaraja wrote a commentary 
on the Khan^akhddyaka. 

In the fourteenth century, Mahendra Surl (c. a.d. 1320), a disciple of 
Madana Suri and native of Vrgupura, flourished in the court of Emperor 
Firoz Shah Tughlak as one of his principal court astronomers. He wrote a 
tract entitled Yantrardja or Yantrardjagama which dealt with astronomical 
instruments based mainly on Persian sources, in the course of the following 
five chapters, Ganita, Ghafand, Yantraracand, Yantrasodhana and Yantra- 
vicar ana. His disciple Malayendu Surf prepared on it a gloss called 
Yantrardjafikd, 

Towards the end of the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth 
century there lived at Alattur (lat. 10'" 15') on the Malabar coast Parame^vara, 
a versatile and prolific commentator, who is believed to have flourished 
between a.d. 1360 and 1460. He belonged to a family of astronomers and 
was a disciple of Rudra. His works include a commentary on the Surya- 
siddhdnta, the Silrya-siddhdnta-vivarana, the Bhafadipikd, a commentary 
on the Aryabhatlya, the Karmadfpikd and the SiddhdntadJpikd on the 
Mahdbhdskariya, the Laghubhdskariya-vydkhyd and the Laghumdnasa- 
vydkhya, a gloss on Manjula’s work. Besides, he wrote a number of indepen- 
dent works, e.g. Drgganita, Goladipikd, Vdkyakarana and Grahariaman(jlana. 
Nilakantha Somasutvan (1465-1545), the noted fifteenth-century commen- 
tator of the Aryabhatiya, was a disciple of Damodara, son of Parame§vara. 
This Nllakantha, besides his Aryabhatiya-bhdsya, one of the best commen- 
taries available on the subject, wrote a number of independent astronomical 
works, e.g. Tantra-samgrahay Siddhdnta-darpana, Candracchdydganita and 
Golasdra. His works are marked by originality and refined methods of 
astronomical calculations. Some other commentators of this period include 
Gahgadhara, the author of Candramdna (a.d. 1434), who lived south of 
the Vindhyas, Makaranda of Banaras, the author of Tithipatra (a.d. 1478), 
a tract on handy tables based on the Surya-siddhdnta, used extensively by 
the almanac-makers, and Lak^mldasa, the author of Ganitatattva-cintdmani 
(a.d. 1500), a commentary on the Siddhdnta4iromani. 

The production of secondary astronomical literature in the form of 
commentaries continued unabated in the sixteenth century, and we hear of a 
number of distinguished families of astronomers assiduously engaged in 
the task of propagating their science. Jnanaraja (c. a.d. 1503), son of 
Naganatha, flourished at Parthapura, a small village at the confluence of 
the Godavari and the Vidarbha. His Siddhdnta-smdara is a full-fledged 
astronomical work in 18 chapters. His son Suryadasa was an accomplished 
coinmentator and wrote on Bhaskara IPs Lildvati and Bijaganita, Ga^e^a 
Daivajiia (c. a.d. 1507) of Nandlgram, a place about 40 miles from 
Bombay, attained eminence through his Grahaldghava, Bf^haHithicintdmarii,

Laghutithicintdmani, Siddhdnta-siromani-vydkhyd and a few other tracts. In 
his Grahaldghava, trigonometrical calculations were avoided and simpler 
arithmetical methods introduced instead. Bhaskara II had followed such 
simplified methods in his Karanakutuhala in the determination of shadows. 

A Maharastrian brahmin, Divakara, son of Rama and a disciple of 
Ganesa Daivajna, established a line of astronomers whose activities con- 
tinued for four generations. He was a native of Golagram (lat. 18° N, 
long. 78° E) on the northern bank of the Godavari. A genealogical table 
showing the names of his sons, grandsons and great grandsons is given 
below. Of his five sons, Vi§nu (b. a.d. 1566) wrote a karam work entitled 
Saurapaksa-ganita; Mallari (b. 1571) produced a commentary Siddhanta- 
rahasya on Grahaldgham and other tracts; Visvanatha (b. 1578) was a

prolific writer producing commentaries on the Surya-siddhdnta, Graha- 
Idghava, Karanakutuhala, Tithipatra, Siddhanta-siromani and several other 
works. Divakara’s grandson Nrsiipha (b. 1 586), trained in astronomy by his 
uncles Vi§ou and Mallari, worked at Banaras and wrote the commentaries, 
the Saurabhd^ya and the Vdsandvdrttika on the Surya-siddhanta and the 
Siddhdnta-Mromani respectively. Of Nrsiipha’s four sons, Kamalakara 
(b. 1616) made his mark through his Siddhanta-tattvaviveka, based largely 
on the Surya-siddhUnta, in which were incorporated new materials from 
Arabic and Persian sources. His criticism of Bhaskara II and appreciation 
of Islamic astronomy led him into a bitter controversy with MunTSvara. 
Nfsiipha’s youngest son Ranganatha (c. 1640) is known for his Siddhdnta- 
cQ^mani, a commentary on the Surya-siddhdnta and his Laghubhahgh 
vibhahgf written in refutation of Munl^vara’s methods of finding true 
planetary positions. 

Another reputed family of astronomers was represented by VallSla 
who migrated from his ancestral home in Elachpur in Madhya Pradesa 
to Banaras. Of his five sons, K^sna Daivajna (c. 1565) studied under 
Vi§ou, son of Divakara of GolagrSm, and wrote excellent commentaries 
on Bhaskara IPs mathematical works. Kf^pa’s brother Ranganitha 
(c. 1573) became well known for the Guifh&rtha-prak&iikd, a commentary

Sawdi Jai Sing II (1686-1734), Jaganndtha {b, a.d. 1652) 

In the beginning of the eighteenth century a new interest in astronomy 
was created by the efforts of Maharaja Sawai Jai Sing II of Jaipur, an able 
statesman, great scholar, skilled astronomer and patron of learning. He 
developed an interest in astronomy at an early age and assiduously studied 
the Hindu, the Arabic and the European systems of astronomy, as is evident 
from the rich collection of his library and biographical references. He 
was acquainted with the principles of Ptolemy’s Almagest and Euclid’s 
Elements, in Arabic versions, and knew well the works of Nasir al-Din 
at-Jusi, al-Gurganl, Jamshid Kashi and Ulugh Beg, leaders of the Maragha 
school of astronomers. That he came deeply under the influence of Arabic 
astronomy and methods of astronomical observations and planned his 
observatories after Maragha, there seems to be little doubt. He also 
procured and studied some important European works of the day, such 
as Flamsteed’s Historia Coelestis Britannica, la Hire’s Tabulae Astronomicae, 
and miscellaneous mathematical works, including spherical trigonometry 
and logarithms. 

Jai Sing’s interest in astronomy was not merely theoretical. It was 
motivated by a strong desire to set up efficient modern observatories for 
improving upon the observational data and for producing more accurate 
astronomical tables. His principal Hindu astronomer Jagannatha informs 
us that he was skilled in the use of astronomical instruments and clever in 
exhibiting new methods with globes and instruments. He set up in Jaipur, 
Delhi, Ujjain, Banaras and Muttra astronomical observatories where a 
large number of his giant instruments such as the Samrdt Yantra (huge 
dials), Jai Prakdi (hemispherical dial), Dak^inovrtti Yantra (meridian circle), 
^a^tyamia Yantra (sextant), RdH Yantra (Zodiac dial), etc., were con- 
structed in masonry. The results of observations carried out under 
his direction by his team of astronomers formed part of his astronomical 
table, the Zlj Muhammad Shdhi, prepared both in Persian and in Sanskrit. 
About the need for improved observations, theZ/y records as follows;® 

‘He (Jai Sing) found that the calculation of the places of the stars 
as obtained form the tables in common use, such as the new tables 
of S’aid Gurgani and Khaquani, and the Tasahllat-Mula Chand Akbar 
Shahl and the Hindu books, and the European tables, in very many 
cases give them widely different from those determined by observation: 
especially in the appearance of the new moons, the computation does 
not agree with observation.*

‘Although this was a mighty task, which during a long period of 
time none of the powerful Rajas had prosecuted; nor among the tribes 
of Islam, since the time of the martyr prince, whose sins are forgiven, 
Mirza Ulugh Beg, to the present, which comprehends a period of more 
than three hundred years, had any one of the kings possessed of power 
and dignity turned his attention to this object . . . 

The reasons for constructing massive instruments in masonry instead 
of going in for brass and metal instruments which the Arab astronomers 
preferred are given as follows: 

‘But finding that brass instruments did not come up to the ideas 
which he had formed of accuracy, because of the smallness of their 
size, the want of division into minutes, the shaking and wearing of 
their axes, the displacement of the centres of the circles, and the shifting 
of the planes of the instruments, he concluded that the reason why the 
determinations of the ancients, such as Hipparchus and Ptolemy, 
proved inaccurate, must have been of this kind. 

‘Therefore he constructed in Dar al-Khalafat Shah Jahanabad 
(Delhi), which is the seat of empire and prosperity, instruments of 
his own invention, such as Jai Praka§ and Ram Yantra and Samrdf 
Yantra, the semi-diameter of which is of eighteen cubits and one minute 
on it is a barley corn and a half— of stone and lime in perfect stability, 
with attention to the rules of geometry and adjustment to the meridian 
and to the latitude of the place, and with care in the measuring and 
fixing of them, so that the inaccuracies from the shaking of the circles 
and the wearing of their axes and displacement of their centres and 
the inequality of the minutes might be corrected. Thus an accurate 
method of constructing an observatory was established and the difference 
which had existed between the computed and observed places of the 
fixed stars and planets by means of observing their mean motions 
and observations was removed.’ 

Significant as his efforts were in establishing and developing observational 
astronomy, Jai Sing’s importance lay in his realization of the fact that the 
progress of science depended on drawing upon knowledge and know-how 
from wherever these were found. A patron of Hindu science and learning, 
he admired Arabic astronomy and did not hesitate to turn to Christian 
Europe as soon as he learnt of the efforts of their savants in the science of 
the heavens. In 1728 or 1729 he sent Father Figueredo, a Portuguese 
Jesuit, to Europe to collect astronomical information and literature. He 
invited to Jaipur Father Boudier, a French Jesuit missionary of Chander- 
nagore, who was an able astronomer and had determined accurately the 
longitude of Chandernagore. 

His principal court astronomer was JagannStha (b. a.d. 1652) who, 
at the instance of his patron, mastered Arabic and Persian and translated 
Ptolemy’s Almagest and Euclid’s Elements from their Arabic versions 
into Sanskrit. The Samrd\~siddh^ta, the Sanskrit title of the Almagest,

contained 13 chapters, 141 sections and 196 geometrical propositions. The 
Rekhdganita was the name given to the Elements, Hunter records that 
at Ujjain he met a grandson of Jagannatha and found in his possession 
several Sanskrit translations of European mathematical works, includ- 
ing Euclid’s geometry, plane and spherical trigonometry and Napier’s 
logarithms. 

The good start made by Jai Sing and the excellent work done by the 
people he gathered round him came to an abrupt end at his untimely death 
in 1743. 


SOME ASTRONOMICAL TOPICS IN THE SIDDHANTAS 

In this section we shall deal with some of the salient features of Hindu 
mathematical astronomy as generally taught in the various texts summarized 
in the foregoing section. 

THE SPHERE AND THE COORDINATES, DIRECTION, PLACE AND TIME 

In all the texts the earth is assumed to be an immovable sphere at 
the centre of the universe. The asterisms with the sun, the moon and other 
planets have a retrograde motion, that is from east to west, completing 
the circle in a day; the sun, the moon and the planets have a direct motion 
of their own, that is from west to east, as a result of which they are con- 
stantly beaten by the asterisms and fall behind them. As we have noticed 
previously, Aryabhata showed that the apparent daily retrograde motion 
can be explained by the direct rotation of the earth, a view opposed by 
other Hindu astronomers. 

The Sphere and some Important Great Circles 

To represent the positions and motions of the planets, stars and heavenly 
bodies, a celestial sphere of an arbitrary radius R is imagined, at the 
centre of which lies the earth or the observer. A vertical line through the 
observer meets the celestial sphere above and below at points Z, Z' (Fig. 2.1) 
called the zenith (urdhva svastika) and the nadir {adha svastika). The plane 
passing through the observer 0 at right angles to the vertical line ZZ' cuts 
the celestial sphere in a great circle NESW, called the observer’s celestial 
horizon {ksitijd). The horizon passes through the four cardinal points, 
north, east, south and west. Thus Varahamihira in his PaHcasiddhdntikd^ 
says: ‘That (circle) in which the sky is joined as it were to the earth is called 
“horizon”; in it are drawn east-west and north-south lines.* Varaha used 
the term harija for horizon. 

The east-west and the north-south lines are easily determined by observ- 
ing the points where the shadow of the gnomon touches a circle drawn on 


• RS/.,xiv. 17. 



104

the horizontal plane in the forenoon and in the afternoon. The line joining 
these two points is parallel to the east-west line passing through 0\ the 
north-south line passing through O is perpendicular to the former. All 
Hindu texts give clear rules for finding these cardinal directions. 

The great circle NZSZ' passing through the north-south points and 
the zenith and the nadir is the meridian {yamyottara~\rtta). The great 
circle EZWZ' through the east-west points and the zenith and the nadir 
is called the prime vertical {sama~man(^ala). Brahmagupta, in his Brahma- 
sphuta^siddhdnta,^' defines these circles as follows: ‘One circle called the 
sama-mandala has its plane stretching east and west; another lying north 
and south is called the ydmyottara-\rtta\ another termed the ksitija encircles 
the other two like a girdle. At the common centre of these circles is 
situated the observer on the earth.’ 


Z 



Fig. 2.1 The celestial sphere and 
some important great circles. 

In Fig. 2.1, the great circle QELW represents the celestial equator 
(vifumnman^ala) of which the poles are P, P'. The angular distance of 
the pole from the horizon equals the latitude ^ of the observer, which is 
equal to the zenith distance of Q, the point where the celestial equator 
meets the meridian. Brahmagupta defines the equator as the circle which 
meets the horizon at the east-west points and of which the top lies to the 
south of the prime vertical by the latitude of the observer, and the bottom 
as much to the north of it. Varahamihira defines the interval between the 
pole and the horizon as the terrestrial latitude of the observer. Diurnal 
motions of planets and stars are represented by small circles parallel to the 
equator.

Of the hour circles or secondaries to the equator special importance 
attaches to the 6 o’clock circle passing through the pole and the east-west 
points. In Hindu astronomy this is called unman^ala which, as Aryabhata 
says, is above and below the horizon by the amount of the observer’s 
latitude. The increase and the decrease of the day and night are measured 
on this circle. 

Finally, we have the ecliptic {apaman4ala) which is inclined to the 
equator at an angle of 24°, meeting later at the first point of Aries 
(Mesa) and the first point of Libra (Tula). Aryabhata states that the 
northern half of the ecliptic is from the beginning of Mesa to the end of 
Kanyd and its southern half is from the beginning of Taulya to the end 
of Mina.^ 


z 



Coordinates 

In representing the positions of celestial bodies, the horizontal, the 
equatorial and the ecliptic systems are used. In the horizontal system, 
the altitude (unnata) or the zenith distance (nata) is defined as in modern 
astronomy, but the azimuth is reckoned from the prime vertical either from 
the east or the west point on the horizon, but never exceeding 90°. The 
azimuth circle is called the drgmandala and the azimuth the digamsa. In 
the equatorial system, the two coordinates are the declination or kranti 
and the hour angle. Kranti is the angular distance of the body from the 
equator measured along its secondary through the body. Hour angle is 
measured in two ways, either by the unnata-ghati (time-altitude) or by 
nata’gha(i. Unnata-ghafi is the hour angle between the declination circle 
through the body and that through its rising point on the horizon; nata- 
ghafi is the hour angle between the declination circle through the body 
and the meridian. In the ecliptic system, the position of a body is given 
by its latitude (vik^epa) and its longitude (sphufa) measured from the fixed 
point marked by 2^ta Pisdum (Revati),

Latitude^ Zenith Distance and Declination 

When the sun is at either of the equinoxes, its meridional zenith distance 
is equal to the latitude of the observer. This is easily determined by 
measuring the equinoctial shadow (visuvatprabhd, palabhd, etc.) AH, cast 
by the gnomon OA (Fig. 2.2). 

Let OA g, AH S,, OH = h 


The latitude {ak^a), and the colatitude {lamba), 90 —^, are given by 
sin (^ = - ~ ?1 — ; R sin (90-(/>) = —=M=z . 

Also 

c - g sin 
* ■“ sin (90-(j^) ■ 

The Surya-siddhdnta^ gives the above rules as follows: ‘Radius multiplied 
respectively by the equinoctial shadow and the gnomon and then divided 
by the equinoctial hypotenuse gives the sine of latitude and the sine of 
colatitude.’ 

For any declination 8^ north of the equator or Sg south of the equator, 
the meridional zenith distances Zj and Zg are given by^ 

R sinZi = ^ 

R sin Zj = ^ 

Ih 

where S 2 are the shadows and hi, h^ are the corresponding hypotenuses 
of the gnomon. From Fig. 2.2, 


=Zi+8i 


that is, 


^ = Zg— 82 
= Zi8. 


Thus the declination of the sun can be found from the latitude of the place 
and the meridional zenith distance. In this way the maximum declination 
or the obliquity of the ecliptic with the equator, given in Hindu astronomical 
texts as 24°, must have been determined. 


Relation between the Decimation, the Longitude and the Obliquity of the 
Ecliptic with the Equator 

The Surya-siddhanta^ gives the relation between declination, the lon- 
gitude and the obliquity of the ecliptic with the equator as follows: 
‘The sine of the greatest declination is thirteen hundred and ninety-seven; 


• Sa.SL,'ui, 13, 14, 16,17. 


15. 





ASTRONOMY 


107 


by this multiply any sine, and divide by radius; the arc corresponding to 
the result is said to be the declination.’ According to Bhaskara I,® the R 
sine of the given longitude, multiplied by 1397 and divided by the radius, 
yields the R sine of the declination for that instant of time. 

The relationship may be expressed as follows: 

_ . - 1397./? sin A /? sin e . /? sin A 

Rising ^ = 

where 8 = declination of the sun; € = obliquity of the ecliptic with the 
equator = 24°; R sin € = 1397'; A = longitude of the sun, that is the 
sun’s angular distance from the first point of Aries along the ecliptic; 
R = radius of the sphere = 3438'. The above formula follows readily 
from the properties of the spherical triangle as also from the geometry of 
the similarity of triangles (Fig. 2.3).

Since e is known, this formula can be applied to find out the longitude of 
the sun from its declination. 


The Ascensional Difference or Cara 

The formula for finding the ascensional difference or cara affords 
yet another example of the skilful use of the celestial sphere and its circles. 
The ascensional difference is variously defined as the difference between 
the right ascension and oblique ascension of a rising point on the ecliptic 
or the difference between the times of the rising of the sun on the horizon 
and the 6 o’clock circle (icnman^ala). In Fig. 2A{a\ H is the rising point 
on the ecliptic T^C, T is the vernal equinox, yEQ is the equator and E 
the east point. The ascensional difference FE is clearly the difference 
between the oblique ascension yE and the right ascension yF of the rising 
point H, FE is also equal to the arc HG or Z. HBG (Fig. 2.4(6)) which

represents the time difference of the sun’s risings on the horizon and the 
6 o’clock circle. 

In Fig. lAb) (see also Fig. 2.4(c)), NES is the horizon, EQ the equator, 
P the pole, Z the zenith, HGR the diurnal circle of the sun (or star), 
PGE the 6 o’clock circle, Z PON = the latitude of the place, <^, and 
Z ROQ = Z BRO = the declination of the sun (or star), 8. The two 
important elements in the above constructions are the radius RB of the 
diurnal circle, which is called the ‘day radius’ (dinavyasadala) and the

extra length AB intercepted between the plane of the horizon and that of 
the 6 o’clock circle; this length AB is called the earth sine {ksitijya). Now,

The ascensional difference Z HBG (denoted by A a) is given by {see 
Fig. 2.4(J))

This rule is expressed by Bhaskara I as: ‘The earth sine multiplied by the 
radius and then divided by the day radius gives the arc called the ascensional 
difference {caradala) by the good astronomers.’ 


THE AHARGANA AND THE METHOD OF COMPUTING THE MEAN 
LONGITUDES OF PLANETS 

We have seen that since the time of composition of astronomical 
siddhantas all Hindu texts give as a rule the number of revolutions of each 
planet in a mahdyuga as also the number of civil days in such a yuga. 
Thus we know the time period in civil days of the revolution of each planet. 
At the beginning of the mahdyuga or at the commencement of special 
epochs such as the Kaliyuga all planets were in conjunction at the initial 
point of the sphere, that is their longitudes were zero. If the number of 
civil days elapsed from the beginning of an epoch up to any point of time 
is found, the mean longitude of any planet can be calculated by dividing 
the elapsed civil days by the time period of the planet. The quotient will 
give the number of times the planet returned to the initial point and the 
remainder expressed in degrees, minutes and seconds the mean longitude. 
If the reckoning is made from any other arbitrarily chosen epoch, it will 
be necessary to know the longitudes of planets at the beginning of such an 
epoch. 

The number of civil days elapsed during any interval of time is called 
ahargana. Where dates are kept according to a solar calendar, the 
ahargana can be found simply by counting the days. But the difficulty 
arises when dates are given according to a luni-solar calendar. In a luni- 
solar calendar, a saura year is defined as the time taken by the sun to travel 
through the 12 signs of the zodiac (or ecliptic), the lunar month is the time 
interval between two new moons and the day is reckoned by the tithi or 
lunar day which is one-thirtieth of the lunar month. A lunar month has 
29-5 days so that 12 lunar months contain 354 days and 13 lunar months 
384 days approximately; in other words, a saura year cannot contain an 
integral number of lunar months, necessitating some years to consist of 
12 and some of 13 months. The 13th month is an intercalary month. 
In the ahargana calculations, as we shall presently see, it is necessary to 
know the number of such intercalary months in a mahdyuga. A saura 
month is the time taken by the sun to travel through one sign so that there 
are 12 saura months in a year. The number of saura months in any given 
length of time is the difference between the numbers of lunar and intercalary 
months. 

A lunar month has 29-5 civil days and 30 lunar days, which means 
that the lengths of a civil and a lunar day are different. Thus, a year of 
12 lunar months contains 354 civil (sdvana) days and 360 lunar days, that is 
more lunar days than the civil days. Such extra lunar days are called 
‘omitted tithis* or ‘omitted lunar days’ (k^ayaha). Therefore, in any given 



110 


A CX)NCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


length of time, the number of civil days is the difference between the number 
of lunar days and the number of omitted lunar days. 

Suppose we are required to calculate the aharganOy that is the number 
of civil days elapsed in time Let / be y years, m months (lunar) and 
d days (lunar); y may be expressed in :§aka era or in Kaliyuga era, the 
relation between the two eras being

Mg = number of saura months in time t\ 
mi = number of lunar months in time t;

Dq = number of omitted lunar days in a mahdyuga;

PLANETARY THEORIES 

The planets, along with other celestial bodies, appear to move west, 
daily rising in the east and setting in the west, these revolutions taking place 
parallel to the celestial equator. In this apparent western motions, the 
planets are, however, constantly beaten by the asterisms and fall behind. 
In other words, with reference to the stellar frame, the planets really move 
eastward along the ecliptic with different angular velocities. The Hindu 
astronomers beheved that the linear speeds of planets, in yojanas, are all 
equal, with the result that the planets describing orbits closer to the earth 
apparently move more swiftly than those describing these orbits at greater 
distances from the earth. The planets in the ascending order of distances 
from the earth are the moon, mercury, venus, sun, mars, jupiter and saturn. 
‘The moon being below’, writes Aryabhata,® ‘completes its small orbit in a 
short time. Saturn being above all others completes its large orbit in a long 
time.’ He says further on, ‘The zodiacal signs (a twelfth of the circle) are to 
be known as small in a small circle and large in a large circle. Likewise 
the degrees and minutes are the same in number in the various orbits.’^ 
These imply the necessity of dealing with angular distances in describing 
planetary motions. 

In their direct motion, that is from west to east, the planets appear 
sometimes to move slowly, very slowly, fast and very fast. Sometimes, 
their motions appear even retrograde. The Surya-siddhdntaP describes such 
peculiar planetary motions in the following manner:

A CX)NCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


‘The motion of the planets is of eight kinds: retrograde (yakra\ somewhat 
retrograde {amvakra), transverse (kutila), slow (manda), very slow 
(mandatara\ even (sama), also very swift {iighratara), and swift (Jighra): 

We now know that all these apparent peculiarities are due primarily 
to the following: (1) the planets excepting the moon revolve in orbits of 
which the centre is not the earth, but the sun; (2) the earth and with it 
the observer revolve once a year about the sun; (3) in consequence of their 
distances, mercury and venus revolve round the sun in orbits smaller than 
the earth’s; these are called inferior planets; mars, jupiter and saturn, 
called superior planets, revolve in orbits larger than the earth’s; (4) the 
planetary orbits are really not circles but ellipses with the sun at either 
focus. 

To the ancients, firmly entrenched in their belief in the immobility 
of the earth, a heliostatic explanation of such planetary irregularities was 
clearly impossible. Although the Pythagoreans, Aristarchus of Samos 
and a few others in antiquity had favoured a heliostatic model, such a 
model was not used for planetary explanations. On the other hand, 
several geostatic schemes were devised, of which the eccentric-epicyclic 
model ultimately came to dominate ancient and medieval astronomy up 
to the time of Copernicus. The geometric eccentric and epicyclic methods 
and their applications to planetary motions were in all probability dis- 
covered by Apollonius of Perga (c. 230 b.c.), utilized successfully by 
Hipparchus (c. 130 b.c.) to account for solar and lunar inequalities and most 
exhaustively dealt with and applied by Ptolemy (c. a.d. 140) in the devel- 
opment of his famous planetary theories. The Hindus also adopted the 
eccentric-epicyclic model in the process of reconstruction of their astronomy 
during the first few centuries of the Christian era. It is likely that the Greek 
planetary theories of the period between Hipparchus and Ptolemy influenced 
the Hindu astronomers of the period engaged in the task of reforming 
their own system. 

Eccentric Model 

This model is represented by 
Fig. 2.5 in which ACPy A'CP' are two 
circles of equal radii, with centres at 0 
and 0\ A'P passing through the two 
centres is the apse line. Let two bodies, 
one in each circle, move with the same 
angular velocity in direct, i.e. anti- 
clockwise direction, reaching A, A or P, 

P' at the same time. To an observer at 
O the angular motion of C will appear 
uniform, but that of C variable. By 
the time the body in the first circle has 
moved from A to C, the body in the

113 


second has moved from A* to C such that Z CO A = L CO' A' = L NCC, 
But seen from 0, C has moved through the Z CO A' and has fallen 
behind C by Z COC or Z OCO'. As the two bodies approach P and P', 
C will appear to the observer at 0 to move with greater angular velocity 
than C. Thus a body moving with uniform speed in an eccentric circle will 
appear from the centre to move more slowly at the apogee A' and more 
rapidly at the perigee?'. 


Epicyclic Model 

The same result can be obtained by the epicyclic model (Fig. 2.6) in 


X 



Fig. 2.6. Epicyclic mode). 


which C is moving in an epicycle of 
radius equal to 00', the distance be- 
tween the two centres in the eccentric 
model (Fig. 2.5). C is moving in the 
epicycle with the same angular velocity 
in retrograde, i.e. clockwise direction, 
as its centre C is moving on the concen- 
tric (or deferent circle) in anti-clockwise 
direction. It is clear that Z A'CC = 
Z CO A, Z COC is the angle by 
which the body falls behind C and is 
the same as obtained by the eccentric 
model given above. 


The Inequality of the Sun 

The eccentric or the epicyclic method as described above can be readily 
applied to determine the inequality of the sun or any other planet due to 
apsis. The mean sun is supposed to revolve on the concentric ACP, Its 
longitude is reckoned from the first point of Aries y (^ = 0). The true 
sun C is moving in the circle A' CP' in the eccentric model or in the epicycle 
in the epicyclic model.

This is the formula for the equation of centre as given in the Surya-

by assuming r to be negligible. In Hindu astronomy the process is called

The Planetary Schemes 

Motions of planets involve two inequalities, one due to planet’s apsis 
and the other due to its conjunction with the sun. Planetary schemes must 
therefore be capable of dealing with both these inequalities satisfactorily. 
The following three schemes are possible: 

(a) Eccentric-eccentric—both the inequalities are determined on 

eccentric model; 

(b) Eccentric-epicyclic— the first inequality is obtained on the eccentric 

model and the second inequality on the epicyclic model; 

(c) Epicyclic-epicyclio-both the inequalities are determined on 

epicyclic model. 

We shall here discuss only one of the three schemes, e.g. the eccentric- 
epicyclic model (Fig. 2.7(a), (b)). O is the centre of the concentric ACP 
(radius = R), A the apsis and 00' the eccentricity (rj). If C be the mean

position of the planet on the concentric, its true position on the eccentric 
circle will be C such that CC is parallel to the line of apsis OA\ Join CO 

cutting the concentric at Q. Then Q 
is the corrected position of the planet 
C and Z COC or Z OCO' is the 
equation of the centre. 

For the second inequality, an 
epicycle is drawn with C as centre and 
radius CC is drawn parallel to 
OS or 0'S\ the direction of the sun. 
Join CO cutting the concentric at C 2 . 
Then Cg is the corrected position 
of the planet due to conjunction with 
the sun and Z C 2 OC 1 is the second 
inequality due to conjunction. 

The net correction is really given 
by the Z COCg and it is possible to 
derive an equation involving both 
the mean anomaly and the mean 
argument. But such a formula is 
unsuitable for the computation of 
correction tables. Both Ptolemy and 
Hindu astronomers, from practical 
considerations, preferred to calculate 
the two corrections separately and 
then combine them to obtain the true 
longitude. 

The formula for calculating the 
first correction, i.e. the equation of 
centre, has already been given above. 
To find the second correction due to 
conjunction, called iighraphala by the 
Hindus, a simplification is introduced. 
The centre of the epicycle is taken to be Q on the concentric (Fig. 2.1(b)) 
instead of at C. The mean argument is also reckoned from the line OCi 
and not from OC or O'C, the latter being the more correct procedure. 

Z CiOS = Z CC^N = mean argument = y 
L C 2 OC 1 = correction due to conjunction = a

radius of the epicycle = rg (rj being the eccentricity due to apsis).

The above method of finding the equation of the argument, that is the

for the various geometrical and trigonometrical elements involved are as

THE SIZES OF THE SUN AND THE MOON, THEIR DISTANCES FROM 
THE EARTH, ECLIPSES AND PARALLAX 

We have seen that from Vedic times the Indians were interested in 
the phenomena of solar eclipses. Good descriptions of them have been 
preserved in the Brdhmam literature, but scientific studies of them were 
perfected in the siddhanta period. The mythological and the Purapic 
Rdhu’Ketu theory which had become firmly entrenched in the minds of 
laymen and even astronomers and continued long thereafter gave place 
to the scientific one based on the relative positions of the sun, the moon 
and the earth and the shadows cast by the moon on the earth or by the 
earth upon the moon. Contrary to the Purapic idea of Rdhu devouring 
the sun or the moon, Aryabhafa says: ‘The moon obscures the sun and the 
great shadow of the earth obscures the moon. When at the end of the 
true lunar month (at new moon) the moon, being near the node, enters 
the sun, or when, at the end of half month (at full moon), the moon enters 
the shadow of the earth, that is the middle of the eclipse, which occurs 
sometimes before and sometimes after the exact end of the lunar month 
or half month.’® Varahamihira explodes the Rdhu-Ketu myth and says that 
the real cause of a lunar eclipse is the entry of the moon into the 
earth s shadow and likewise at the solar eclipse the moon enters the sun. 


• A, Cola, 37 - 38 . 



ASTRONOMY 


117 


A very clear and lucid exposition of eclipses is given by Bhaskara II in his 
Siddhdnta-^iromani, section Golddhydya, chapiQT Grahavdsand, He says: 
‘The orbit of the moon is below that of the sun. Just as a cloud moving 
from behind covers the sun so does the moon moving faster covers the sun 
from behind. That is why the western part of the sun is eclipsed by the 
moon first and the eastern side released last. Owing to differences in the 
latitude eclipses are sometimes seen and sometimes missed.* Then follows 
a discussion on the need of parallax correction and so on. 


TTie Diameters of the Sun and the Moon and their Distances from the Earth 

For the calculations of the shadows cast either by the earth or the 
moon it is necessary to know the diameters of the discs of the sun and the 
moon, the earth’s diameter and the distances of the sun and the moon 
from the earth. Different astronomical texts give different values of these 
elements, some of which are summarized in Table 2.5. 

The ratio of diameter to distance gives the angular diameter of the 
sun or the moon in radians. It is to be noted that the angular diameters 
of the sun and the moon are nearly the same and agree approximately 
with the modem values. To obtain the angular diameters in minutes, 
the above-mentioned ratios are directed in Hindu astronomical texts to be 
multiplied by R (= 3438') which is the equivalent in minutes of one radian. 
Taking Bhaskara IPs figures, the mean angular diameters of the sun and 
the moon work out to 32-5' and 32' respectively. 

The values of the diameters of the sun and the moon, given above, arc 
those for their mean orbits and therefore require to be corrected due to their 
motions in eccentric circles. This correction is done by multiplying the 
mean diameters by the ratio of the true daily motion to the mean daily 
motion. Thus, if and be the true and mean daily motions of the sun, 
those for the moon, / and d, be the true and mean diameters 
of the sun and d^ and d^ those for the moon, the following relations are 
to be applied:®

Calculation of the Length and the Diameter of the Earth's Shadow 

Aryabhata I and followers of the Aryabhata school (Bhaskara I and 
others) give the following simple rule for the length of the shadow (measured 
from the earth to the tip of the umbral cone) and the diameter of the shadow 
at the mean orbit of the moon as follows: 

Length of the earth’s shadow - 


' sun’s diameter— earth’s diameter '

or (3) 

Conditions of Eclipse 

Let us now consider the situation at a lunar eclipse. The earth’s 
shadow and the moon about to enter it will both be near the node, the

point of intersection between the ecliptic and the moon’s orbit. In Fig. 2.9, 
ON is the ecliptic, MN the moon’s orbit, N the node, 0 the centre of the 
shadow of diameter S 1 S 2 and 
M the centre of the moon’s 
disc of diameter AfjA/ 2 . 

Let S = diameter of shadow, 
cl^ = diameter of moon, 

^ = OM = latitude of 
moon. 

Then e.g. the part 

of the moon eclipsed, is 
given by

This relation is given in the Surya-siddhanta^ which further says: 
a lunar eclipse will take place if > j8 ; 

a total lunar eclipse will take place if \(S+d^)-p > d ^ ; 

or 

and a partial lunar eclipse will take place if ; 

or l(S^dJ<^<l(S+dJ. 

Duration of the Eclipse 

It is now possible to calculate the duration of an eclipse and derive a 
simple relation for such duration.

LMi = OM = latitude of moon = P; during the progress of the 
eclipse the latitude is assumed to remain constant as an approxi- 
mation and for simplicity of calculation. 

Then OL = MMi = JoM^—OM^, assuming LOMMi to be a rectangle, 

Let Vg— be the relative diurnal motion of the moon with respect 
to the sun (or its shadow) and tg half the time of duration from first to

In the same way, ty, half the time of total obscuration, called vimarddrdha, is 
calculated from the following expression : 


ty = — — j 82 ghatikds or nd<fis 

The above relations also hold good for solar eclipse in which the 
diameter of the sun’s disc is to be substituted for that of the earth’s shadow, 
and the latitude is corrected for parallax. 


Parallax 

The solar eclipse is complicated by the phenomenon of parallax. The 
sun and the moon will be in conjunction with respect to the earth when 

these bodies and the centre of the earth 
lie in the same straight line. To an 
observer on the horizon at the same 
time, this will not be so (except when 
the sun and the moon are at the zenith), 
because both the sun and the moon will 
appear differently depressed on account 
of their unequal distances from the 
earth. The angle made by the two 
straight lines joining the body to the 
centre of the earth and the observer on 
its surface is the geocentric parallax 
of that body. Thus Z. OMC and 
Z OSC are the geocentric parallaxes 
respectively of the moon at M and the 
sun at S (Fig. 2.11). For the horizontal positions of the sun and the moon 
when their zenith distances are 90°, the respective geocentric parallax is 
called the horizontal parallax (Z OM^C, L OS^C), The peculiarity of the 
Hindu astronomers was that they did not deal with the absolute parallaxes 


Z 



122 


A CX)NCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


of the sun and the moon, but considered only their differences, that is the 
LMCM" in the first and Z.MfjCM' in the second case, which was sufficient 
for eclipse calculations. Moreover, they made use of parallax only 
in connection with the eclipse calculations, but did not apply it for other 
astronomical purposes. 

If for the position M of the moon, the zenith distance /. MOZ' be z, 
radius of the earth be r and the distance of M from the centre of the earth 
C be /?, then geocentric parallax p is given by 


r . 

or ^ ~ ^ P small. 

For 2 = 90°, p = horizontal parallax, p^ = rjR, so that 

/7 = /7osin2 (1) 

This sinusoidal relationship is implied in all Hindu treatment of parallax 
as we shall presently see. 


Z 



Fio. 2.12 Latitudinal and longitudinal parallax. 

In Hindu astronomical works the horizontal parallax of the moon or 
the sun is given as of their daily motion. For the moon it is 52' 42' 
and for the sun 3' 56', making their horizontal parallax difference equal 
to 48' 46' or 4 ghafikas (fifteenth part of a day) in time. 

For eclipse calculations, it is necessary to resolve the geocentric parallax 
into two components, one in the direction of the ecliptic, called the longi- 
tudmal component, and another at right angles to the ecliptic, called the

ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS 

Several types of simple astronomical instruments were in use among 
astronomers in India in ancient and medieval times. Some of these instru- 
ments have been variously described in the astronomical samhitds and 
siddhdntas. These instruments include water clocks, gnomon, staff, arc, 
wheel and the armillary sphere. 

The Water Clock or Clepsydra 

The use of water clocks is referred to in the Veddhga Jyoti^a, The 
earliest type probably consisted of a simple vessel having a small orifice 
at its bottom, permitting water to flow out in a fixed unit of time, say a 
nddikd. In course of time the water-flowing type gave place to the sinking 


• 5w. Si„ iv, 7. 



ASTRONOMY 


125 


type in which a metal vessel with a hole was permitted to sink in a larger 
vessel containing water. The Surya-siddhdnta describes such a sinking 
type clepsydra which is ‘a hemispherical copper vessel, with a hole in the 
bottom, set in a basin of pure water, sinking sixty times in a day and night’. 
Descriptions of similar water clocks are met with in the works of Brahma- 
gupta, Lalla, Bhaskara II and others. Wc know from I-Hsing’s account 
that water clocks were indispensable in Buddhist monasteries, and skilled 
mechanics used to be maintained by the king for their upkeep. 

The Gnomon {Sahku) 

In its simplest form it is a vertical rod with 12 divisions. It is 
mentioned in the Atharvaveda and some of the Brdhmanas. The Sulba- 
sutras mention the use of the gnomon for the determination of cardinal 
points. Its description as well as details of its use in astronomy are given 
by Varahamihira in his Pahcasiddhdntikd, by Bhaskara I, Brahmagupta, 
Lalla and Bhaskara II. ‘Take for a gnomon a cylindrical piece of ivory’, 
writes Bhaskara II, ‘and let it be turned on a lathe, taking care that the 
circumference is equal above and below; its shadows will enable the deter- 
mination of the points of the compass, the observer’s place, its latitude, etc., 
and the time.’ 

The Cakra or Circle 

It is a circle of which the circumference is divided into 360 degrees. 
Provided with an axis at the centre perpendicular to its plane and suspended 
with a string, the circle was used for finding zenith distances and longitudes. 
Brahmagupta and Lalla mention an instrument called pJtha which is also 
a circle with an upward staff attached to it. Bhaskara II describes a versatile 
phalaka yantra which is essentially a circle or cakra which possibly served 
the purpose of an astrolabe. 

Capa, Dhanu, Kartari, Turlya 

The cdpa is a half circle; dhanu is an arc; kartari is also a type of arc 
instrument; turiya is a quadrant. The first one is mentioned by Bhaskara II, 
the second type is mentioned by Brahmagupta and Bhaskara II, the third 
type is referred to in the !§isyadhlvrddhida and so on. The word turiya 
is mentioned in the figveda in connection with the description of an eclipse, 
but it is doubtful if the word had anything to do with a quadrant. 

The Armillary Sphere {Gola Yantra) 

This is really a wooden model of the celestial sphere showing the 
various great circles used in astronomy. The model gola yantra was used 
mainly for purposes of demonstration. The outer sphere called khagola 
(the celestial sphere) has a polar axis called dhruvaya^fi. The sphere consists 
of a number of great circles to represent the horizon, the meridian, the 



126

equinoctial, the prime vertical, the 6 o’clock circle and so on. The altitude 
or the azimuth of any star is indicated by a movable altitude-azimuth circle. 
The horizon is divided into degrees counted either from the east-west 
points or the north-south points. Inside the khagola is fixed another 
sphere, the bhagola, on which are represented the ecliptic, the lunar and 
planetary orbits called the ksepa-vrttas, the declination and diurnal circles. 
This can be made to revolve round a polar axis. In the same manner 
there is a third sphere, the drggola, which is supported on the axis of the 
khagola produced. The whole arrangement of the armillary sphere is 
such that the khagola and dfggola remain fixed while the innermost bhagola 
alone can be made to revolve. 

There is a good description of an armillary sphere in the Surya-siddhanta, 
the Siddhanta-i^iromani and several other astronomical texts, which 
clearly shows the care and pains taken by the Hindu astronomers in eluci- 
dating the principles of spherical astronomy to those who wanted to master 
the science of the heavens. 

Astronomical Instruments of Jai Sing's Observatories 

We have already noticed Sawai Jai Sing’s efforts in developing obser- 
vational astronomy in India towards the end of the seventeenth and the 
beginning of the eighteenth century. Jai Sing used both metal instruments 
such as then were in vogue among Muhammadan astronomers and massive 
masonry instruments of his own design and construction. 

The Astrolabe 

Among the metal instruments, the astrolabe naturally occupied the 
most important place. This versatile instrument although known to the 
Greeks was perfected by the Islamic astronomers in West Asia, Central 
Asia and Spain and travelled to India along with Arab astronomy. The 
Jaipur collection includes an astrolabe dated the 31st year of the reign of 
Shah Jahan and a Zarqali astrolabe dated the 23rd year of the reign of 
Aurangzeb. Such astrolabes have also been found in other places in India, 
some of which are at present preserved in a number of Indian museums 
and libraries. Most of them are engraved in Persian characters, but a 
few engraved in Ndgari characters have also come down to us. Among 
the medieval astrolabe-makers in India we hear of Zia’u’d-din Muhammad, 
son of Qa’im Muhammad, son of Mulla Isa, son of Sheykh Allah-Dad.® 
A number of astrolabes in which his name is engraved have been preserved. 
The family worked in Lahore. ZiaVd-din was a skilled astrolabe-maker; 
his father Qa’im and grandfather Allah-Dad were skilled mechanics, 
proficient in the making of globes and astronomical instruments. 

Astrolabes (Arabic A^furldb) are of three types, e.g. the spherical, 
the flat and the rod. Of them the flat type representing the projection of 
the celestial sphere on a plane is the most popular. Also known by the

name of ‘planisphearum’, it is a small portable metal disc instrument, of 
which the diameter varies from about V to 8" (Fig. 2. 13(^7)). The instrument 
consists of a disc, called the ‘mother’ or umm, provided with a raised rim 
graduated in 360 degrees. The inner front surface, the ‘face’, is called the 
wadjih and the outer back surface the ?ahar. Within the inner front surface 
of the ‘mother’ are set a number of circular tablets called ?ufd'ih. The 
circular tablets are generally nine in number and are marked with circles 
parallel to the horizon, projections of vertical circles, equator, etc. 



Fig. 2.13(fl). Astrolabe, The ‘ face’, showing 

the graduated rim, the ‘spider’ and the circular 
tablets as seen through the ‘spider’. 

In the ‘mother’ immediately above the circular tablets is set the most 
conspicuous part of the astrolabe, e.g. the ‘spider’ or ‘aranea’, Arabic 
"ankabut or shabaka. The ‘spider’ (Fig. 2.13(^)) is an open circular structure 
so designed that the circular tablets below can be easily seen through. It 
consists of an eccentric circle, the ecliptic, of which the rim is divided into 
12 parts, each bearing the name of a zodiacal sign. A number of pointed 
metal strips artistically cut project inside from the rims of the centric and

the eccentric circles. Each strip bears the name of a bright star. The 
fine points of the ornamental metal projections are called indicators, 
shazlyd. The ‘spider’ is capable of rotation round the central pivot. With 
the help of several circular tablets, the ‘spider’ enables the user to find the 
longitudes and latitudes of stars, the hour of day or night from the observed 
altitude of the sun or the stars and so on. 

On the back of the astrolabe there is a revolving piece called the diopter 
or al-i(fdd€ (Fig. 2.13(c)). It is a ruler of length equal to the diameter 
of the circular back, each end being sharpened to a point and containing 
a hole through which the sun’s rays pass or the stars can be sighted. The 
two arms of the ruler are graduated but differently. The al-*‘iddde revolves 
round an axis passing through the centres of all the various pieces held 
together by a bolt and a screw at either end of the axis. The back of 
the astrolabe is divided into four quadrants (Fig. l.\\d)). The rim of each 
of the two upper quadrants is graduated in degrees at intervals of 5°. 
One of them is marked by a set of equidistant parallel lines dividing the 
vertical radius into 60 equal parts; these are called lines of sines from 
which the sines are read off. Other quadrant contains a number of 
declination circles. The lower quadrants contain circular scales and 
rectangular markings for shadow measurements with a gnomon fitted in 
the centre. In other designs, the back is provided with a number of 
concentric circles and chronological indications forming a sort of perpetual 
calendar.^* 


Masonry Instruments 


Masonry instruments built under Jai Sing’s instructions to equip the 
observatories at Jaipur, Delhi and other places include huge dials, azimuth 


A 



instruments, meri- 
dian circles, sextants 
and several varia- 
tions of them. Of 
the huge dials 
designed by Jai Sing 
himself, the most 
important was the 
equinoctial dial 
called samrdt yantra 
(Fig. 2.14). It is 
a right triangular 
gnomon ABC with 
its hypotenuse AB 
parallel to the 
earth’s axis; to the 
gnomon is attached

a quadrant circle DEFG parallel to the plane of the equator. Each edge 
of the quadrant is graduated in hours and minutes, as also in degrees. 
The gnomon itself is provided with tangent scales. 

Jai prakd^ is a hollow hemispherical dial provided on its concave 
face with a number of coordinates. The edge of the hemisphere represents 
the horizon. Cross-wires are stretched along north-south and east-west 
directions. Only Delhi and Jaipur observatories are fitted with a jai prakds 
dial; the diameter of the instrument at Delhi is 27' 5" and that at Jaipur 
11 ' 10 ". 

Ramyantra is a cylindrical instrument which is open at the top and 
has a central pillar. The inside circular wall and the floor are graduated. 
The floor and the wall are broken up into a number of sectors to facilitate 
observations. Wall sections are provided with notches in which sighting 
bars can be fitted horizontally. Hunter compared it with a kind of cylin- 
drical astrolabe referred to by al-Birunl. This is also an instrument 
characteristic of Delhi and Jaipur observatories. 

Other instruments comprise the digamsa yantra which is a large 
circular protractor. It consists of a central pillar 4' high surrounded by 
an inner wall of the same height and an outer wall of double the height 
of the former. Both walls are graduated. The instrument is used for 
azimuth observations. The nddivalaya yantra is a circular dial, the 
dak^inavrtti yantra is a meridian circle, the sasiamsa yantra is a graduated 
meridional arc, and the raii valaya is a set of 12 dials for use in connection 
with the rising signs of the zodiac from which the sun’s longitudes can be 
determined. 


INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIAN, GREEK, 
CHINESE AND ARABIC ASTRONOMY 

India, owing to her pre-eminent geographical position, was always a 
meeting-place of many nations and cultures. This enabled her from the 
very beginning to play an important role in the transmission and diffusion 
of ideas. Needless to say, it was a two-way traffic in the course of which 
her own ideas and achievements in religion, science, arts and literature 
travelled abroad with as much facility as those of her neighbouring and 
far-flung nations flowed into her own borders to cross-fertilize her very 
same endeavours. Her cultural and commercial contacts with West Asia 
and Egypt extended to prehistoric times. In historic times, the 
Achaemenian Empire and the Graeco-Bactrian kingdoms provided an 
effective bridge between India at one end and West Asia and the Mediter- 
ranean world at the other. Ptolemaic Egypt and Rome’s Eastern Empire 
developed a thriving commercial and trade relations with India. After 
the spread of Buddhism into China, India, naturally enough, became the 
place of pilgrimage of Chinese Buddhists, and in this way was opened up 
a Sino-Indian intercourse in scientific and cultural exchanges which lasted

for several centuries. The opening up of ‘silk-roads’ and the consequent 
flow of trade and commerce through Central Asia also contributed to the 
process of such exchanges. The rise of Islam witnessed a new interest 
in India and in her savants. In spanning the world from Spain to South- 
East Asia and establishing her political and commercial supremacy over 
half of the old world, Islam acted as the natural carriers of ancient knowledge 
as cultivated among various peoples and, in the process, helped in the 
preservation and further development of that knowledge affecting India 
in no small way. 

Against the above historical background it is futile to hold extreme 
views such as that Indian astronomy was wholly of indigenous development 
or that it was derived wholly from a foreign source. This is true not only 
of India but of all cultures to a greater or less degree, for, in the develop- 
ment of knowledge, each culture, marked as it was by its own genius and 
individuality, depended heavily on the efforts of others. 

Much of the Vedic astronomy, as we have seen, was of a primitive 
nature capable of independent development wherever an agrarian civilization 
took root. Its only important sophistication was the development of a 
stellar zodiac, the naksatra system, to follow the motions of the moon and 
the sun. Such a system also characterized the early primitive astronomy 
of contemporaneous civilizations in China and West Asia. This occasioned 
a controversy as to whether the Indian naksatra^ the Chinese hsiu, the 
Babylonian lunar mansions or the Arab manazil originated independently, 
if not, whether any of them having the pride of priority influenced the 
development of all the rest, or whether each of them had a common origin. 
This question of origin has, however, still remained an unsolved problem. 
In the meantime, the naksatras fortified by the high antiquity of the Rgveda 
and the Yajurveda texts in which these were first mentioned, by the fixity 
of their number (27 or 28), and by their consistent use as a stellar frame- 
work in calendrical astronomy, maintained their characteristic position 
in Indian pre-scientific astronomy. 


INFLUENCE OF BABYLONIAN AND GREEK ASTRONOMY 

The position is different when we come to Indian astronomy of the 
Siddhantic period. Although records bearing on this transitional phase 
of Indian astronomy are very scanty, what we know clearly seems to indicate 
unmistakable foreign influence. Such a conclusion of foreign, e.g. Greek 
and Babylonian, influence is based on eulogistic references to Greek as- 
tronomy and astronomers, transliteration into Sanskrit of Greek technical 
terms and principles and methods typical of Greek astronomy, the historical 
development of which is untraceable in earlier Sanskrit literature. 

Garga and Varahamihira have referred to the proficiencies of the 
Greeks (yavanas) in astronomy and even stated that although they were 
miecchas they should be honoured as f^is. As to the use of Greek technical 



132 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


words, Varahamihira in his Brhajjataka gives the names of the zodiacal 
signs as follows; Kfiya (Mesa), Tavuri (Br^a), Jituma (Mithuna), Leya 
(Sitpha), KulJra (Karkafa), Fathom (Konya), Juka (Tula), Kaurpya (Vrkika), 
Tauksika (Dhanu), Akokera (Makara), Hrdroga (Kumbha) and Ittha (Mina). 
Other examples are liptd, minutes; hora, hour, horoscope; dresk&m or 
dfkkdm, decan; dpoklima, inclination; kendra, anomaly; jyamitra, chord 
(lit. lover of chord), etc. These and other technical terms were used in the 
same sense by Paulus Alexandrinus (c. a.d. 378), the author of Eisagoge, 
an astrological work. 

As to astronomical parameters, principles and methods of foreign 
origin which found their place in the Indian system, Varaha’s Pahca- 
siddhantika throws some light. Pradyumna and Vijayanandin who flourished 
before Aryabhata I made a special study of the superior and inferior planets 
and probably had access to Babylonian sources. P. C. Sengupta suggested 
that Babylonian elements thus transmitted to India were developed into 
a fuller planetary theory by Aryabhata I who did very much the same 
thing for Indian astronomy as Ptolemy had done for the Greek. Further 
evidence of Babylonian influence is provided by the computation of lunar 
motions as given in the Vaksfha-siddhanta, This text yields the value of 
the anomalistic month as 27; 33, 16, 22 ... in sexagesimal unit, which is 
in remarkable agreement with the Babylonian value of 27; 33, 16, 26, 54. 
It is very likely that the convergents of the anomalistic month, e.g. 
and discovered in a tablet from Uruk and discussed by Schnabel, 

were known to the author of the Vasisfha-siddhSnta. Recently David 
Pingree drew attention to an astrological text, the Yavanajataka of Sphuji- 
dhvaja (a.d. 269), which contained the use of Babylonian linear methods 
in planetary calculations. 

The Romaka- and the PauUsa-siddhanta, of which the very titles indicate 
foreign origin, were long taken to represent Greek or Alexandrian-Greek 
astronomy. Although already indianized, the Romaka was still using 
the Metonic cycle and the period followed by the Pauliia was different 
from the yuga of later Hindu astronomers. In one of them the ahargana 
is calculated for the meridian of Yavanapura, and in the other the difference 
in the longitudes of Yavanapura and UjjayinI is expressly given. With 
regard to other elements of astronomy discussed in these works, similarities 
with those of the Greek astronomy were noticed, which led Thibaut to 
observe: ‘ ... it certainly appears highly probable that the PauliSa^ and 
Romaka-siddhdntas were the earliest Sanskrit works in which the new 
knowledge imported from the West was embodied.’ Be that as it may, 
even the earliest account of these works as preserved by Varaha clearly 
shows significant modifications. In mathematical computations the Greek 
chords were replaced by the half-chords, i.e. sine functions, and convenient 
tables were constructed accordingly. In the planetary theories, although 
the geometrical models were adopted, the longitudes of apogee, the sizes 
of the epicycles and other related parameters were different, agreeing in 
many cases more closely with observations.

INDIAN ASTRONOMY IN CHINA 

Sino-Indian religious and cultural intercourse which might have started 
about the beginning of the Christian era became really intensified from 
the time of Yueh-Chih Dharmarak§a (third-fourth century a.d.) and the 
Kashmirian Kumarajiva (fourth-fifth century a.d.) who visited China by 
the overland Central Asian route. During the following centuries 
a steady stream of Buddhist scholars from Kashmir, Western, Central 
and Eastern India visited China to carry out their missionary activity. 
Their main activity was no doubt confined to preaching the Buddhist 
doctrines and translating canonical texts, but some of them doubtless 
were engaged in spreading secular learning such as astronomy, mathematics 
and medicine. In the catalogue of the Sui dynasty (a.d. 610) are mentioned 
a number of Brahminical works on astronomy, of which some are enumerated 
below: 

(1) Po-lo-men fien-wen-ching — Brahminical astronomy, in 21 books; 

(2) Po’lo-min chieh-chieh hsien-jen-wen-shuo — Astronomical dis- 

sertations of the Brahmana Chieh-chieh, in 30 books; 

(3) Po-lo-men fien-wen — Brahminical astronomy, in 1 book; 

(4) Po-lo-min yin yang Suan ching — Brahminical method of 

calculating time, in 1 book. 

Nothing is known about the contents of these works, but the very 
titles and their careful listing in a dynastic catalogue clearly indicate an 
interest in Indian astronomy among the Chinese scholars in the beginning 
of the seventh and possibly in the sixth century a.d. In the seventh century 
again we hear of an Astronomical Board at Chang-Nan where Indian 
siddhantas bearing the names of Gautama, Kasyapa and Kumdra used to be 
taught. The Thang dynasty records mention astronomers bearing the name 
‘Ch’u-t’an’ which is the Chinese transcription of the Indian name ‘Gautama*. 
Ch’u-t’an Hsi-ta (meaning Gautama Siddha or Siddhartha), an astronomer 
in the Thang Court (eighth century a.d.), translated an Indian calendar 
under the Chinese title Chiu-Chi-li. The navagraha or the astronomy of 9 
planets, the Rdhu-Ketu theory of eclipse and other peculiarities of Hindu 
astronomy began to appear in the Chinese astronomical literature from 
about this time. Its influence can be somewhat guessed from the fact 
that I-hsing, a noted Tantric-Buddhist astronomer of the Thang period, 
was asked by the emperor to study the principles of Indian astronomy and 
mathematics introduced to China by Hsi-ta and other scholars. 


INDIAN ASTRONOMY AMONG THE ARABS AND IN LATIN EUROPE 

Astronomy among the Arabs at the time of their embracing Islam 
was rather in a primitive state. They had some practical knowledge of 
stars, the motions of the sun and the moon, which they utilized for purposes 
of reckoning time. Their interest in scientific astronomy was aroused 



134 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


by the knowledge that the Hindus of India and the Persians of the Sassanian 
period had cultivated among themselves a better and more scientific system 
of astronomy indispensable for the making of accurate and reliable calen- 
dars. Ibn al-AdamT, in the preface of his astronomical tables Nam aUiqd, 
records the visit during the reign of Caliph al-Mansur of an Indian astrono- 
mer who brought with him to the Caliph’s court planetary tables, texts 
for the calculation of eclipses, ascension of signs and other matters of 
astronomical import. The astrologer Abu-Mashar of Balkh mentions an 
Indian astronomer from whom he derived the knowledge of the Hindu great 
cycle of ‘Kalpa’. These visits and references doubtless proved useful, for 
very soon, under orders of al-Mansur, Brahmagupta’s Brahmasphuta- 
siddhanta and Khandakhadyaka were translated into Arabic with the 
assistance of Hindu pandits, by Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Fazarl {d. 796 or 
806) and Ya’qub ibn Jariq (d. 796). In the Arabic translations these 
works were known as Sindhind and Ark and. 

About the same time al-TamimI translated the Pahlavi astronomical 
tables, the Zik-i Shatro-ayar^ into Arabic under the title Zij ashshahriyar. 
This Persian work was compiled in the closing period of the Sassanian 
Empire and exerted considerable influence on the growth of the early phase 
of Arabic astronomical literature. We have it from al-BirunI that the 
Shatro^aydr itself was based on Hindu astronomical methods of compu- 
tation and parameters. In fact, Hindu astronomical texts were eagerly 
sought for, studied and translated into Arabic with a view to getting a 
better understanding of the Persian tables. 

Kennedy, in his excellent survey of Islamic astronomical tables, 
has given an impressive list of such tables which were either translations 
of siddhantas or based on methods and parameters contained in them. Some 
of these works include the Astronomical Tables of al-KhwarizmI (c. 840) 
revised later by Maslama al-Majrltl (r. 1000) of Spain, Az-Zlj al-Mukhtari 
of al-Hasan bin Mi§bah (r. 870), Az’Zlj aUKabir of an-Nairizi (c. 900), 
Mukhtasar az~Zij of ibn as-§af!ar (c. 1 100). Some of the Arab astronomers 
like ibn Yunis and al-Battani who followed Ptolemy in the compilation 
of their Zijes had access to the Sindhind and occasionally used Hindu 
parameters. In this transmission al-Birun! (973-1048) played a distinctive 
role. Instead of directly translating the texts as al-Fazari, ibn T^riq and 
others did, he discussed Indian astronomy and astronomical methods 
critically in his Ta'rikh aUHind, aUQdnun aUMai'sudly comparing and con- 
trasting them with those of other systems. Interest in Hindu astronomy 
declined among the Eastern Arabs after they were acquainted with the 
works of Ptolemy, Theon of Alexandria and other Greek authors in their 
Arabic translations, but peculiarly enough Hindu astronomy and astrono- 
mical parameters continued to remain popular among the astronomers of 
Spain. 

Some of the special features of Hindu astronomy which were in this 
way incorporated in Islamic Zijes are the zero meridian of UjjayinI which 
assumed the name ‘ Arin’, the era of Kaliyuga (February 17-18, 3102 b.c.)

which became the ‘Era of Flood*, the Hindu planetary theory, the tables 
of sine (R = 150), the tables of solar declinations, methods of spherical 
trigonometry, ascensional difference, calculation of parallax and its appli- 
cation to solar eclipse, etc. 

The elements of Hindu astronomy passed into Latin Europe through 
Latin translations of some of the Islamic Zfjes mentioned above. The 
most conspicuous of them is Adelard of Bath’s (c. 1142) translation of 
al-Khwarizml’s astronomical tables in the version of the Spanish as- 
tronomer Maslama al-Majriti. Another incomplete Latin translation of 
al-Khwarizml’s tables has been found in Corpus Christi College, Oxford, 
which has recently been edited, translated and commented upon by Neuge- 
bauer. In 1951, Lynn Thorndike published and translated an anonymous 
fifteenth-century Latin manuscript Ashmole 191 II, in which computations 
were made for the geographical latitude of Newminster, England, for the 
year 1428. The study of astronomical parameters and tables given in the 
unsuspecting manuscript has revealed the characteristic features of Hindu 
astronomy and another interesting instance of transmission as late as the 
fifteenth century possibly through Arabic (Spanish) intermediaries. The 
Newminster manuscript begins the Era of Flood from the year 3102 s.c. 
which is the beginning of the Kaliyuga era and uses the sine functions 
instead of the Greek chord, tabulating them for /? = 150, a norm used in the 
Khan(jlakhadyaka and in the Toledan Tables. 

In this way Hindu astronomy itself modified by the elements of 
Babylonian and Greek astronomy travelled, through the powerful vehicle 
of Arabic language, as far west as England. The circuit was completed 
when, with the establishment of the Ghaznavid and the Mughal rule in 
India, the Greek or rather the more advanced Ptolemaic astronomy in 
Arabic version reached India and began to be studied and taught at first 
exclusively among the Muslim circles and gradually among select Hindu 
astronomers who appreciated its merit, its more refined mathematical 
techniques and observational standards.

MATHEMATICS 


S. N. Sen 


The history of the development of mathematics in India is as old as 
the civilization of its people itself. It begins with the rudiments of metro- 
logy and computations in prehistoric times, of which some fragmentary 
evidence has survived to this day. The sacred literature of the Vedic 
Hindus— the SamhitaSy the Kalpasutras and the Vedahgas—coviid^n enough 
materials, albeit scattered, to help form a good idea of the mathematical 
ability during the time of development of this class of literature. The 
Sulba-siitras which form part of the Kalpasutras are a veritable storehouse 
of information concerning enumeration, arithmetical operations, fractions, 
properties of rectilinear figures, the so-called Pythagorean Theorem, surds, 
irrational numbers, quadratic and indeterminate equations and related 
matters. The Brdhmanas and some sutras contain interesting materials 
concerning progressive series, permutations and combinations. 

Of the various religious sects that attained prominence in the closing 
phase of the Vedic period, the Jainas deserve special notice for their interest 
in, and cultivation of, mathematics. Their canonical literature lays great 
emphasis on mathematics and enumerates various topics such as number 
reckoning, fundamental operations, geometry, mensuration, fractions, 
equations, permutations and combinations. In some departments they 
made advances further than where the Vedic Hindus had left off. 

Indian mathematics received a new lease of life during the first few 
centuries of the Christian era. The demands of astronomy, particularly the 
need for more accurate computations of planetary motions, eclipses, etc., 
were in no small measure responsible for this. From now on we meet with 
a succession of mathematicians and astronomers and a fairly steady growth 
of mathematical-astronomical literature. The mathematical contents of 
this literature and its voluminous commentaries have for obvious reasons 
occupied the greater part of the discussion in the following pages. 

The medieval period witnessed the growth of a sizeable mathematical 
literature in Arabic and Persian and presented an opportunity for cross- 
fertilization of the efforts of two distinct cultures. How far that oppor- 
tunity was seized has been discussed. 



MATHEMATICS 


137 


Situated at the cross-roads of many cultures, it was not given to Indian 
mathematics to develop in isolation. Although what happened in the most 
ancient times must remain a matter of speculation, records of late ancient 
and medieval times show that Indian mathematics stimulated mathematical 
endeavours abroad and itself received inspiration from neighbouring and 
distant culture areas. Such stimuli have been noticed even in the case of 
the complex and many-sided phenomenon of European Renaissance of the 
sixteenth century. 

METROLOGY AND COMPUTATIONS IN PREHISTORIC TIMES 

It is reasonable to believe that the builders of the Indus civilization 
developed a good degree of skill in their measuring and computational 
techniques. Without these it is difficult to comprehend their town-planning 
and architectural proficiencies and various other aspects of their civilization. 
As to metrology, we have the evidence of seals with pictographic 
inscriptions and numerous stone weights unearthed at Mohenjo-daro and 
Harappa. The pictographic inscriptions have not yet been deciphered, 
but by measuring the large number of weight specimens in modem 
units one can guess what their weight system possibly was. From the 
published masses of these weights, frequency charts have been constructed, 
which clearly show that these weights were intended to be fractions or 
multiples of the uncia.^ Thus 288 specimens of small cubes of chert have 
been shown to fall under seven distinct groups. By assuming 1 uncia 
equal to 27*2 gm., these groups are as follows: 

1 uncia = 27*2 gm. 

2 „ =54-4 „ 

5 „ =136 „ 

The discovery in large numbers from both the sites of the weight specimens 
of mass 13*6 gm. has led others to suggest this as the probable unit. The 
existence of a developed weighing system is further borne out by the dis- 
covery from these sites of the remains of quite a few metal scales used 

probably for weighing light 
and precious substances. 

An interesting specimen 
of the Indus scale has come 
down to us among the finds 
from Mohenjo-daro in the 
form of the fragment of a 
Fio. 3.1. Sketch of an Indus scale, measuring 6*62 cm. in 



uncia = 1-7 gm.

length by 0-62 cm. The scale shows nine parallel lines cut with a fine saw. 
One of these lines is marked by a fine circle and the sixth line from it by a 
dot (Fig. 3.1). The measurement of these five intervals shows 1-32 inches 
making the distance between two consecutive lines equal to 0*264 inch. If 
the length between the circle and the dot can be called the Indus inch, as 
Berriman did, this becomes exactly equal to 2 Sumerian shushi. Another 
significance of the Indus scale is that 25 Indus inches equal 33 inches which 
again equal the yard prevalent throughout north India in Akbar’s time. 

Mackay® conjectured that the aforesaid scale was a part of the whole, 
probably 13*2 inches long, and hinted at a decimal mode of dividing and 
measuring lengths such as was characteristic of ancient Egypt and Elam. 
It is then easy to think that such a decimal scale appeared in some original 
centre of diffusion in West Asia and then spread to other centres of culture. 
This does not preclude the possibility of independent development in 
different centres. 

Indus seals and inscriptions, as found in Mohenjo-daro, show that 
numbers were represented by vertical strokes arranged side by side or in 
lateral groups. This might probably be some kind of rod numerals, of 
which we have many examples in other ancient culture areas, notably 
among the Chinese and the Mayans.

How far they went with such rod numerals in representing higher numbers 
like 10, 20, 30 ... or 100, 200 and so on, it is not possible to say. Some 
of the vertical or horizontal strokes, as we shall see later, survived in the 
Kharostbl and BrahmT numerals. 

MATHEMATICAL KNOWLEDGE AS REVEALED IN THE 
SAM HIT As, THE BRAHMANAS, THE VEUAmAS 
AND RELATED LITERATURE 

SURVEY OF LITERATURE 

In the chapter on survey of source materials, we have noticed briefly the 
various sections of the Vedic literature, e.g. the Samhit&s, the Brdhmanas and 
the Vedangas. This vast sacred literature contains enough material to help 
form a good idea of the mathematical ability of the Vedic Hindus. These 
materials are mostly scattered and diffused in the Samhitds and the Brdh- 
manas. We are somewhat more fortunate with regard to the Veddhgas, for 
two of them, the Kalpasutras (ritual) and the Jyotm (astronomy), directly 
concern a large body of mathematical knowledge without which neither the 
construction of various kinds of sacrificial altars nor the reckoning of time

for calendrical purposes would have been possible. This debt to mathe- 
matics or the science of calculation {ganand, raii-vidya) was freely ac- 
knowledged and the study of mathematics was always given a pride of place 
in the various branches of learning. When Sanat Kumara wanted to know 
from Narada the various sciences and arts the latter had studied, he gave 
a list which included astronomy and mathematics. In the Vedanga Jyotisa, 
the science of calculation has been likened to the crest on the peacock’s 
head or the proverbial gem on the snake’s hood. Mathematics, along 
with astronomy, was also held in high esteem by the Jaina and the Buddhist 
monks. One of the four branches of the religious literature of the Jainas, 
e.g. the ganitdmyoga, was concerned with the exposition of mathematical 
principles. The Vinaya Pitaka, Digha Nikdya, Divyavaddna and other 
Buddhist texts also expatiate on the importance of the study of ganita or 
samkhydna (science of higher calculations). 

We have referred to the Kalpasutras as an important source of Vedic 
mathematics. One class of this ritual literature is the Srauta-sutra which 
deals with directions for the laying of sacrificial fires for agnihotra, the new 
and the full moon, the seasonal, the somo and other sacrifices. Of special 
importance for our purpose are sections called Sulba-sutras which are 
directly attached to these Srauta-sutras. These sections deal with rules 
for the measurement and construction of the various sacrificial altars and 
consequently involve geometrical propositions and problems relating to 
rectilinear figures, their combinations and transformation, squaring the 
circle, circling the square as well as arithmetical and algebraic solutions of 
problems arising out of such measurements and constructions. The word 
Mba (also spelt as Mva) means a ‘cord’, a ‘rope’ or a ‘string’, and its root 
Mb signifies ‘measuring’ or ‘act of measurement’.® Therefore, works 
entitled Mba-sutras may be literally taken to mean a collection or 
compendium of rules concerning measurements with the help of a cord 
of various linear, spatial or three-dimensional figures. Quite appropriately, 
the Mba-sutras represented the Brdhmana geometry or mensuration, the 
Mba-vijndna, as mentioned specifically in the Mdnava and other Mbas, 
and the Mbavid, the expert geometer, was held in high esteem in the 
learned priestly circles. 

One would expect a Mba section attached to each Srauta-sutra, and 
there are Srauta-sutras belonging to all the four Samhitds. But what we 
possess today are a small number of Mba-sutras attached to the Srautas 
belonging only to the various schools of the Yajurveda. Of them the Black 
Yajurvedins of the Taittirlya school were the most active, and produced 
the most comprehensive Mbas, e.g. those of Baudhayana, Vadhula, 
Apastamba and Hiranyake^in. There are two Mbas by Manava and 
Varaha of the Maitrdyam and one by Laugak§i of the Kdthaka-Kapi^thala 
school. Of the White Yajurvedins, Katyayana, the prolific sutrakdra, is 
credited with a small but more scientifically executed Mba work. The

initiative of the Yajurvedins in producing works of this kind is not surprising 
when we bear in mind that they were the principal custodians of the 
knowledge of sacrificial formulas and specialized in the techniques of per- 
forming various sacrifices. 

The Baudhayana Sulba^sutra is the oldest (600-500 B.c.) and the most 
voluminous work of this class. It comprises 525 sutras divided into three 
chapters. The first chapter of 116 sutras gives geometrical propositions 
required for the construction of altars and deals with their relative positions 
and spatial magnitudes; the second chapter of 86 sutras describes the various 
fire-altars (agnis) and their spatial relationships; the third chapter contain- 
ing 323 sutras is devoted to kdmya agnis or sacrificial altars designed to 
attain desired ends. 

The Mdnava ^ulba-siitra (posterior to Baudhayana), a part of the 
Srauta-siitra by the same author, is a small compilation and gives specifi- 
cations of the measuring tape, gnomon and methods of finding the cardinal 
points not given by Baudhayana or Apastamba. It contains descriptions 
of a number of altars, e.g. the suparna-citi, the pdkaydjmki, the marUti 
and the vdruni, not found in other works. 

The Apastamba Sulba-sutra (500-400 b.c.) comprises 223 sutras distri- 
buted among six chapters. Apastamba covers the same ground and gives 
the same rules as was done by Baudhayana. 

The Kdtydyana §ulba~sutra (400-300 b.c.), also known as Kdtiya- 
hlbaparmsta, is a comparatively small tract of 102 sutras arranged in six 
chapters. Katyayana’s treatment is more succinct and systematic. Like 
Manava, he also gives specifications of the measuring tape, discusses the 
gnomon and its application in determining the cardinal points. Katyayana 
gives solutions of rational triangles and states the Pythagorean Theorem in 
a generalized form. In the sulba, Katyayana deals with different agnis 
and their spatial relations, but not with the kdmya agnis, because the latter 
is discussed in a separate chapter of his Srauta-sutra, 

Other §ulba-sutras referred to are minor works and do not throw any 
additional light. Hiranyakesin’s work is no longer extant, but is known 
from references and occasional extracts in other Mba-sutras. 

We have already noticed the Vedanga and the Area Jyotisa, Although 
these are astronomical works, these offer examples of application of ele- 
mentary mathematics in astronomical computations, divisions of the lunar 
zodiac, calculation of tithis, etc. 


ARITHMETIC 

Number 

Like the Egyptians, the Vedic Hindus adopted 10 as the basis of nu- 
meration and developed a great interest in thinking out and naming large 
numbers. The Greeks, on the other hand, fought shy of large numbers 
and their terminology hardly took them beyond the ‘myriad* (10*). The 
Egyptians freely dealt with large numbers on the decimal scale, such as 



MATHEMATICS 


141 


hundred, thousand, million, tens of million and so on and had meaningful 
Hieroglyphic symbols to express them. The same is true of the Vedic 
Hindus. The various recensions of the Yajurveda Samhitd give names to 
numbers as large as 10^^. The Taittiriya Samhitd^’ gives the following 
denominations: eka (1), dasa (10), saia (lO^), sahasra (10^), ayuta (10*), 
niyuta (10^), prayuta (10®), arbuda (10^), nyarbuda (10®), samudra (10®), 
madhya (10^®), anta (10^^) and pardrdha ( 10 ^^)^ jlie same is repeated 
in the PancavMa Brdhmana with further extensions. The following 
passage from the Pancavimsa Brdhmana^ will give an idea of the context 
and the manner in which large numbers were introduced; 

‘By sacrificing with the agnihotra, he reaches in one day ten “House- 
lords” (i.e. he becomes equal to, gains the merits of ten H.); by sacri- 
ficing with the agnihotra during ten years, he becomes equal to one who 
(regularly) performs the sacrifices of full and new moon, he becomes 
equal to one who performs the sacrifices of soma. By offering the 
agnistoma sacrifices, he becomes equal to one who performs a sacri- 
fice of a thousand cows as sacrificial fee. By offering ten of these, he 
becomes equal to one who performs a sacrifice with ten thousand 
daksinds. By offering ten of these, he becomes equal to one who 
sacrifices with a sacrifice of a hundred thousand daksinds. By 
offering ten of these, he becomes equal to one who sacrifices with a 
sacrifice of a million daksinds. By offering ten of these, he becomes 
equal to one who sacrifices with a sacrifice of 10 million daksinds. 
By offering ten of these, he becomes equal to one who sacrifices with 
a sacrifice of 100 million daksinds. By offering ten of these, he 
becomes equal to one who sacrifices with a sacrifice of 1,000 million 
daksinds. By offering ten of these, he becomes equal to one who 
sacrifices with a sacrifice of 10,000 million daksinds. By offering ten 
of these, he becomes equal to one who sacrifices with a sacrifice of 
100,000 million daksinds. By offering ten of these he becomes the cow.’ 

The method of obtaining higher and higher numbers in multiples of 
10, described later on as dasagunottara, is clearly indicated. The number 
names in this decimal scale in ascending order are: eka, da§a, sata, sahasra, 
etc., the same as given in the Taittiriya Samhitd. It appears that the 
thinking out and the naming of such large numbers were a favourite pastime 
of the ancient Indian mathematicians. The same tendency is noticed in the 
Buddhist literature where we find a centesimal scale {§atottara ganand) and 
the name tallaksana for the number 10®**. The Jaina work, the Anuyo- 
gadvdra-sutra {c. 100 B.C.), called the places in powers of 10 as ganand- 
sthdna and mentioned large numbers up to 29 places and beyond. The 
Jainas are further credited with the conception of a time-scale called ilr$a- 
prahelikd (8,400,000) and the suggestion of building up fantastically large 
numbers in ascending powers of this figure.

The Vedic Hindus showed the same proficiency in developing a scientific 
vocabulary of number names, in which the principles of addition, sub- 
traction and multiplication were conveniently used. The system required the 
naming of (1) the first nine digits, e.g. eka, dvi, tri, catur^paHca, sat, sapta, 
asfa and nava; (2) the second group of nine numbers oMained by multi- 
plying each of the above digits by 10, e.g. dah, vimM, trimiat, catvdriniiat, 
pancasat, sasfi, saptati, asiti and navati ; and (3) the third group of 1 1 num- 
bers beginning with 100 and followed by its multiples of 10 and its higher 
powers, e.g. hta, sahasra, ayuta, . . . parardha (see above). The multipli- 
cative principle is already indicated in forming the numbers of the second 
and third group. Other examples are sastim sahasrdni, paHcdht sahasram, 
dvd-saptatih sahasrdni. The additive principle is generally used in naming 
a number in which the numbers of the first and second group participate, 
e.g. eka-dasa (11), sapta-\im§ati (27), asfa-trimht (38). Additive and 
multiplicative principles are simultaneously used when, in the number 
concerned, the members of the third group participate along with those of the 
second or the first, e.g. sapta §atdni vimsatih (720), ?as(ini-sahasra navatim 
nava (60,099).® These principles were widely used in constructing number 
names in other culture areas, as witness such terms as pente-deka (50), 
pente-hekaton (500) among the Greeks. 

Of greater importance, however, is the infrequent application of the 
subtractive principle for which the Etruscans are generally given the credit.^ 
Proceeding from right to left, they wrote 27 as XIIIXX [20+(10— 3)]; 
38 as XIIXXX [30+ (10— 2)] and so on. The same subtractive principle, 
in the number nomenclature, was applied by the Vedic Hindus in the 
coinage of such terms as ekdnna-§ata (100—1), ekdana-virp^ati (20—1), 
ekdnna-catvdrimsat,^ etc. The word ekdnna, meaning ‘ one less*, was later on 
shortened into ekona and una. In a limited way, the Babylonians also used 

this principle in forming their inauspicious number 19 as < <y>; (20—1), 
where stands for —1. 


Fundamental Operations 

The four fundamental arithmetical operations, e.g. addition, subtraction, 
multiplication and division, are nowhere spelled out in the Vedic literature, 
as these were obviously taken for granted being commonplace operations! 
One, however, meets with the interesting case of dividing one thousand 
into three equal parts in the Rgveda and the Brdhmanas. In the Rgveda, 
the division of the thousand is not explicitly mentioned, but it is 
done so in the Tattirlya Sanihitd^ which, while incorporating the rc, 
modifies the last line as ‘Ye did divide the thousand into three*. The full 
explanation of the arithmetical feat of Indra and Vi§nu in the proposed

MATHEMATICS 


143 


division is given in the §atapatha Brdhmana as follows: ‘For when Indra 
and Visnu divided a thousand (cows) into three parts, there was one left, 
and here they caused to propagate herself in three kinds ; and hence, even now, 
if anyone were to divide a thousand by three, one would remain over.’® 

Fractions 

Acquaintance with the fundamental arithmetical operations with 
elementary fractions is clearly indicated in the Vedic texts and their append- 
ages. The Rgveda gives names of a number of simple fractions such as 
ardha (|), tripada (|) and the Maitrdyam Samhitd mentions pdda (J), hpha 
(J), kusfha (y\), kald From the Sulha-sutras onwards we meet 

with terms such as am^a, bhdga to denote fractions in general. These 
terms are used in combination with cardinal or ordinal number names; 
in the case of the latter the word amsa or bhdga is often omitted. A few 
examples follow: 

tribhdga, tryamsa 
pancama-bhdga, pahcama 
dmdaia-bhdga or dvddasa 
pancada^a-bhdga 
tri-as\ama, tryasta 
dvi-saptama 
trayastryasta 
pancamasya caturvitpia 

There are a number of other peculiar modes of expressing fractions, e.g. 
ardhdsfama (7|), ardhanavama (8|), ardhadasama (9^)^ or dvi-guna (|), 
tri-guna (J), caturgma (|).^ 

The Sulba-sutras contain several instances of addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, division and the squaring of fractions. Consider the follow- 
ing example from Baudhayana:^* 

‘Then he measures the area of this square-shaped citi, whose side 
is three purusas less one-third. At the western side of this square is 
the handle whose east-west length is half a puru^a plus ten ahgulas 
(one-twelfth puru^a) and north-south breadth one puru^a less one-third. 
This makes the (area of the) agni sevenfold plus two aratnis and the 
prddeh* 

Two aratnis and the prddeSa equal 60 angulas or \ purusa. Expressed in 
figures, the above means: 

The area of the agni = (3-D^+(|+j^(l— = l \ .

The results of a few more statements of this nature are given below:

2 25 2 

(2) Number of bricks each ^ of | sq. purusa to cover sq. puru^a 


Progressive Series 

Indian interest in progressive series has been traced to the Samhitds, 
The Taittirlya Sarphitd indicates the following arithmetical series in which 
the odd (ayugma) and the even (yugma) ones are noticeable: 


1, 3, 5, 

2, 4, 6, 

4, 8, 12, 

5, lO, 1 5, 

lO, 20, 30, 


19, 29, 39, . . . 99 

20 
20 
lOO 
100 


The Pancavirnsa Brdhmana^ prescribes daksinds in gold measures 
(mdnas) to be given in geometrical progressions, depending on the nature 
and the time of offerings, as follows: 

12 (gold mdnas), 24, 48, 96, 192 ... 3072, 6144 . . . 49152, 98304, 
196608, 393216. 


In the above examples, the summations of such series are not given. 
This is correctly done in the Satapatha Brdhmana^ as follows: *. . .there 
are seven of these meters, increasing by four syllables; and the triplets of 
these make seven hundred and twenty syllables and thirty-six in addition 
thereto.’ 

In other words, it is proposed to compute 
3(24 + 28 + 32+ . . . 7 terms) = 3x ^{2x24+(7-l)x4} = 756. 

It is true that no general rule for finding the summation as indicated 
above is given in the ^atapatha Brdhmana, But the recurrence of both arith- 
metical and geometrical series, with the correct statement of the results of 
their summation, strongly suggests that the Vedic Hindus probably possessed 
some method of finding the summation of such series. Thus the Brhad- 
devoid (400 b.c.) gives the summation 

2+ 3+4+ . . . +1000 = 500499 

and Bhadrabahu’s Kcdpasutra (300 b.c.), a Jaina canonical work, the sum- 
mation of the geometrical series 

1 +2+4+... +8192 = 16383. 

The series played an important part in prosody. Pingala, in his Chandakt- 
sdtra (200 B.c.), used a geometrical series 2, 2*, 2® . . .

It is noteworthy that the summation of progressive series has ever 
since continued to occupy the attention of subsequent Indian mathemati- 
cians such as Mahavira, Bhaskara II, Naraya^ia and others who have all 
given general formulas for obtaining the sum. In the Sthdndngasiltra, 
progressive series is included in the mathematical topic Vyavahdra, as 
explained by the commentator Abhayadeva Suri (a.d. 1050). Later on, 
it became the subject of special treatises, e.g. Brhaddhdra Parikarma, referred 
to by Nemicandra. 


GEOMETRY 

Postulates 

We have already stated that the various iulba-sutras that have come 
down to us as parts of the Srauta-sutras are Brahma^ic geometrical manuals 
for the construction of sacrificial altars. In the various rules given, certain 
assumptions resembling Euclidean postulates are taken for granted. Thus 
a straight line is capable of division into an infinite number of equal parts; 
a circle can be divided into any number of parts by drawing diameters; 
each diagonal bisects a rectangle and both diagonals bisect each other, 
dividing the rectangle into four parts with the vertically opposite ones equal 
in all respects; a straight line joining the vertex with the middle point of the 
opposite side divides an isosceles triangle into two equal halves; parallelo- 
grams drawn on the same base and between the same parallels are equal 
to one another; a square inscribed within a circle and touching the circum- 
ference is the maximum, and so on. The texts give several rules as to how 
to construct a straight line perpendicular to another straight line, a square 
with a given side, a rectangle with given sides, an isosceles trapezium of a

given altitude, face and base. For constructing a square, Baudhayana 
gives, among others, the following rule: 

‘If you intend to draw a square, take a cord of length equal to the 
side desired of the square. Make a tie at each end of the cord and mark 
its middle point. Draw the east-west line (EW of Fig. 3.2) and fix a 
pole at its middle (0). After fastening the two ties at that pole draw a 
circle with the mid-point of the cord; fix a pole at each end of the diameter 
(along the east-west line). Fasten one tie at the eastern pole and draw a 
circle with the other tie. Likewise, draw a circle round the western pole. 
Join the points of intersections of these circles to obtain the second 
(north-south) diameter; fix a pole at each end of this diameter. Fasten 
both ties at the east pole and describe a circle with the mid-point (of the 
cord). Draw similar circles around the southern, the western and the 
northern poles. The exterior points of intersection of these four circles 
will give the four corners (ABCD) of the required square.’® 


Combinations and Transformations of Rectilinear Figures 


Of greater importance are the rules given in the Mbas for the com- 
bination and transformation of rectilinear figures, specially the squares 
and the rectangles. In a series of rules for transforming a square into a 
rectongle, the simplest one is to draw the diagonal AC of the square ABCD 
to divide it into two equal parts, to divide again one of these parts into two 
equal parts by joining the vertex D with the mid-point E of the diagonal 
and then to fit them suitably one to each side AB and BC of the square 
AFGC is then the required rectangle. In the paitrklvedi, it is often required 
to find one square double of another given square. This is done by joining 
the mid-points of the sides of a square. The thing is achieved by drawing 
on the other side of the diagonal in Fig. 3.3 a similar rectangle AHIC 

When one side of a rectangle is given, the rule of transforming a square 
into a rectangle of the given side is given by Apastamba as follows:*’ 

If you desire to make a rectangle out of a square (cut off from it 
a rwtangle) of a side of the desired length. The excess remaining is 
to be added suitably as to fit (the rectangle cut off).’ 


Baudhayana also gives a similar rule.® The directions are incomplete 
but, according to mterpretations given of the above rule by the commentators 
Sundararaja ^d Dvarakanatha Yajva, the true process appears to be as 
lUustrafed in Fig. 3.4. is the given square. Its side ^ is extended 

o f, so that EB equals the given side of the rectangle into which the square

Baudhayana, Apastamba and Katyayana all teach methods of con- 
structing a square equal to the sum of two different squares. The method

EG F 




is to cut off from the larger of the two given squares, ABCD, a rectangular 
portion ABEF of which the side BE is equal to the side of the given smaller 
square. Then the diagonal AE is the side of the square equal to the sum 
of the two given squares. The proof will follow from Fig. 3.5, in which 
AEGH is the required square, and ABCD and CKGI are the given squares.® 
In other words, the proposed construction is based on what has generally 
come to be known as the theorem of Pythagoras. 


Pythagorean Theorem 

The theorem of the square of the diagonal is more explicitly given in 
more or less the same language in all the Mba-sutras we know of. Here 
is Baudhayana’s definition:^ 

dirghacaturasrasydk^naydrajjuh pdrivamdm tiryahmdnl ca 
yatprthagbhute kurutastadubhayarn karoti \ 

‘The diagonal of a rectangle produces by itself both (the areas) 

produced separately by its two sides.* 

The same definition is given by Apastamba. Katyayana’s definition 
given in the same language is characterized by the explicit mention of the 
knowledge of plane figures: 

dirghacaturasrasydk^naydrajjustiryanmdni pdrsvarndni ca yat 
prthagbhute kurutastadubhayarn karotiti k^etrajhdnam \ 

Note the word iti k$etrajMnam at the end, meaning ‘this is the knowledge 
of plane figures 

A question has often been asked whether such a definition resulted 
from empirical guesswork or was based on a proof of some kind. 
Although it is too much to expect elaboration of a proof in manuals of this 
type there is hardly any doubt that the Vedic hdbavids at this distant date 
possessed a valid proof of the theorem, of which the texts themselves provide

reliable indications. For example, Baudhayana, in the very next rule," 
says that the rectangles for which the above is true have their sides 
3 and 4, 12 and 5, 15 and 8, 7 and 24, 12 and 35, 15 and 36. The sum of 
squares of these numbers is also a square for each pair.

Fig. 3.6. 

The above relationships between sides and diagonals or hypotenuse 
for rational rectangles or triangles have been freely used for finding the 
perpendicular directions (north-south) at the east or the west point of the 
east-west line in altar settings. The method is to take a cord of suitable 
length greater than the distance between the two poles one each at the east 
and the west point, fasten a loop at either end of the cord, fix it with the 
two poles by these loops and then stretch it by the niranchana mark. The 
nirafichma mark divides the cord in two portions x and y such that = 
y\ where a is the distance between the east-west pole (Fig. 3.6). This finding 
of the properties of rational triangles is a strong argument in favour of the 
Vedic Hindus possessing proofs of the theorem of the square of diagonal 
or the hypotenuse. It is possible that by actually drawing the squares on 
the diagonal and the sides of a rational 
rectangle, dividing them into elementary 
unit squares and then counting them, 
they might have arrived at the truth of 
this theorem (Fig. 3.7). 


Question of Origin 

The question of the Greek origin of 
the theorem and also whether Pythagoras 
himself was the discoverer of it and its 
proof has by no means been solved. 
The tradition attributing the theorem to 
Pythagoras is due to Cicero (c. 50 b.c.),

century A.D.), and Proclus (c. a.d. 460), and therefore started about five 
centuries after the death of Pythagoras. Junge pointed out that the Greek 
literature of the first five centuries after Pythagoras contained no mention 
of the discovery of this or any other important geometrical theorem by 
the great philosopher and furthermore emphasized uncertainties in the 
statements of Plutarch and Proclus. Although various attempts have been 
made to justify the tradition and trace the proof to Pythagoras, no 
record of proof has come down to us earlier than that given by Euclid 
(Theorem 47, BK I). As to the relation 4 ^+ 3 ^ = 5^ from which the 
theorem of rational triangle is derivable, very ancient Egyptian knowl- 
edge is attested by the Kahun papyrus of the twelfth dynasty (c. 
2000 B.C.), but its association with rational triangles does not seem 
indicated in this or other Egyptian papyrii.® It is interesting to note 
that among the Egyptians, geometry of surveying was considered to 
be the science of the ‘rope-stretchers’ (harpedonap'tae) who thus appear 
to be the Egyptian counterpart of the Indian Mbavids. As to the antiquity 
of Pythagorean theorem in China, it is stated, though not proved, in 
the arithmetical classic Chou Pei Suan Ching (third or fourth century b.c.); 
the numerical relationship 4, 3 and 5 between the sides and the diagonal 
of a rational rectangle is also given in this text. 

Areas and Volumes 

Regarding other areas of geometry, the areas and volumes of a number 
of plane and solid figures have been given as follows: 

Area of a triangle = | (base) x (altitude) 

Area of a parallelogram = (base) x (altitude) 

Area of a trapezium = |(sum of two parallel sides) x (altitude) 

Volume of a prism or cylinder = (base) x (height) 

Volume of the frustum of a pyramid = - /?, 

where u, b are the length and breadth of the rectangular base, a\ b* the 
corresponding ones of the parallel face, and h is the height. 

Squaring the Circle; tt 

Another type of problem which interested the Mba geometers was the 
circling of the square or its converse the squaring of the circle. Through 
these exercises, the Vedic Hindus were led to finding approximate values 
of TT. For circling a square, Baudhayana’s rule is first to draw the arc of 
a circle about the centre O of the given square ABCD with a radius equal 
to half the diagonal, intercepting the east-west line at P. Then the circle 
drawn about the centre 0 with a radius equal to half the side of the square 
plus one-third of the portion between the (previous) circle and the square 
{OQ = OR+QR where QR = PR/3) answers for the problem. If the side

of the given square be 2a, the radius of the required circle works out to 
flxM380718, taking the value of J2 = 14142156 as given in the Mba 
(vide infra). That the area of the circle 4*068987^i2 jg somewhat higher than 
4 fl 2 is fully reflected in the Mba-sutras. 


P 



For squaring a circle, the same Mba-sutra advises the diameter to be 
first divided into eight equal parts. The last l/8th part is further divided into 
29 parts and then 28 of these subdivisions are rejected (from this l/8th 
part). Furthermore, from it is rejected l/6th of the preceding subdivision

the circle, the side of the required square is given by

From the foregoing operations, it is possible to calculate the value of 
IT. In the example of circling of the square, the radius r in terms of a,

accurate value of w, e.g. 3*16049, is inferable from the data given in the 
Mdnava Sulba-siltra,

ALGEBRA 

The altar geometry of the iSulba’Siitras does not fail to give us a glimpse 
of the beginnings of algebraic notions among the Vedic Hindus. These 
notions include quadratic equations, indeterminate equations, surds, con- 
ception of irrational numbers and determinations of their approximate 
values. 


Quadratic Equation 

The sacrificial ritual often necessitated 
enlargement or reduction of the altar in 
accordance with a number of plans. 

According to one plan, the shape is to remain 
the same, all sides being proportionally 
increased or decreased. The standard 
mahdvediy for example, has the shape of an 
isosceles trapezium having for its face, base 

and altitude 24, 30 and 36 units respectively 

(area 972 sq. units). The standard ^ycna^cit Fio. 3.9fl. MahUvedi. 

(the falcon-shaped altar) consists of a central 

trunk of 4 sq. units, two rectangular wings each measuring 1 by 
^ 11 
ll or Ig sq. units and a rectangular tail (prdde^a) 1 by l^o or Ij^ sq. 

units and has a total 
“ area of 1\ sq. units. 

By the first plan, the 

measures are left un- 
disturbed but the unit 
of length is changed 
as required. Accord- 

ing to another plan, 

some parts of the altar 
are proportionately 
increased while others 
are left undisturbed. 
Thus, in the case of 

syena-city while the 

Fio. 3.96. Syenorcit. units for the complete 

square are propor- 
tionately changed, that of the fractional parts for the two aratnis and 
one prdde&a are left unchanged. If p represents the modified unit and « the 
change in area, we obtain the following quadratic equations for the two 
types of vedis mentioned above: 

T w (30p+24p) 36 X (30+24)^

Specific examples given in the Mba-sutras of Baudhayana, Apastamba and 
Katyayana agree with the solutions of these equations. 


Indeterminate Equations 

The Mbas contain rules for the construction of a square n times a 
given square. The rule involves the application of the diagonal square 
theorem, for it says that the diagonal of the square produces the double 
square, the diagonal of the rectangle formed of 
the previous diagonal and the side of the given 
square gives a square thrice as large, the diagonal 
of the rectangle formed of the previous diagonal 
and the side of the given square produces a 
fourfold square and so on. Katyayana gives a 
general rule for finding a square n times a given 
square. According to this rule, the required 
square will be given by the altitude of an g 
isosceles triangle whose base is (n— 1) times 
and the sum of the two equal sides (/i+l) times 
the side of the given square. That is, in Fig. 3.10, 

BC = (n-l)a, = 





where a is the side of the given square. It is clear that 


If we put n 




= na^. 


the above leads to 


which is a solution of indeterminate equation of the second degree 

x^+y^ = z*. 

The questions relating to finding the sizes and number of bricks required 
for building the different layers of the altars envisage solutions of simul- 
taneous indeterminate equations of the first degree. The Baudhdyana Sulba- 
sQtra prescribes that a gdrhapatya vedi should be constructed with five 



MATHEMATICS 


153 


layers of bricks, each layer containing 21 bricks so arranged that their rift 
in two consecutive layers do not coincide. For a square altar in which 
square bricks are used, Baudhayana says that three kinds of bricks having 
their sides 1/6, 1/4 and 1/3 of the side (vydydma) of the altar should answer 
for the construction. How were the sizes as well as the number of bricks 
determined? Since 21 is not a square number and the rifts of consecutive 
layers must not coincide, square bricks of at least three different sides must 
be used. Suppose a to be the side of the square altar and /j, / 2 , Is the side 
of each of the three square bricks so that = l^Pz = hPz = where 
Ply P 2 y Ps are rational integers. If x and y be the number of bricks of sides 
/i and /g for the first layer, and x' and y' those of sides /g and /j for the 
second layer, we have 

for the first layer, 


for the second layer, 


In other words, the problem leads to the following simultaneous 
indeterminate equations of the first degree: 

x+y = 21 


x^y = 2\ 
xl\+yll = a^ 

2 • 2 
Pi Pi 

x'+y' = 21

Pz Pi 


where m and n are integral parts of a. Although the method of solution 
is not indicated, Baudhayana gives correctly the values of m and /i as 6 
and 4 for X = 9, y = 12 and again as 3 and 6 for x = 5 and y = 16. 


Surds 

The technical expressions used in the Mbas for such quantities as ^2, 

-^4, >/18, etc., are dvi-karam, tr~karam, catu^karani, a^tdda^a-karatfi, 
etc. By using words for ordinal numbers along with karanl, quantities 
s/j, ^/^ are expressed as trtlya-karaifl, saptama-karam, etc. Thus karani 
has been used in the same sense as root or surd. Elementary operations 
with surds are clearly indicated in the various places of the texts. To 
draw a sautramaniki vedi, an isosceles trapezium of the same shape as, 
but one-third the area of, the mahdvedU Apastamba uses the surds as 
follows: ‘For a unit prakrama 1/^3 of a prakrama is to be substituted;

east-west line 12 times Expressed in figures,

n/3 



= 324 sq. units; 

the second direction gives the area = 12^3x^(8^3+10-73) 

= 324 sq. units. 


Irrational Numbers and their Approximate Values 

The Vedic Hindus have been credited further with the notion of 
irrationality of the quantities 72, 73. They have even given the values of 
such irrational numbers up to a high degree of approximation. For the value 
of 72, the exact wordings of some of the Mbakdras are quoted below: 

pramdnam trtlyena vardhayettacca caturthendtmacatus- 
trimhnena | savik^ah 

karanirp tftlyena vardhayettacca svacathurthendtma- 
catustrirpknena savi^esa iti vise^ahi^ 

Both versions having used practically the same wordings, these may be 
rendered as follows: 

‘Increase the measure by its third and this third by its own fourth 
less the thirty-fourth part of that fourth. This is the value with a special 
quantity in excess.’** 

If we take 1 for the measure of a square side, the above formula gives the 
diagonal as follows: 

In the same manner, the value of tr-karani is given by 

^’-'+5+0-3Xs5-'”“’'’ 

The method by which the values of these irrationals were obtained is 
not indicated in the texts. They did not obviously know how to extract 
the square root up to so many decimal places at this distant time. Thibaut, 
Biirk, Miiller, Datta and others have reconstructed possible methods out of 
the very elements and procedures dealt with in the Mbas. For 72, one 
possible method appears to be as follows: 

Two squares of unit side are taken. One of them is divided into three 
equal rectangular strips, of which the first and the second are marked 1

One of the cuneiform tablets from the old Babylonian times (1600 b.c.), 
now in the Yale Babylonian collection, shows a square with its two diagonals 
and values in sexagesimal system, from which V2 in the same system works 
out as 

V2= 1; 24, 51, 10. 

Neugebauer® has shown that the sexagesimal equivalent of the value 
of as given in the hdba-sUtras is 1 ; 24, 51, 10, 37, . . . He has further 
hazarded a guess that both the main term and the subtractive correction 
of the Hindu value were based ultimately on Balylonian approximations. 
The more ancient character of the Babylonian cuneiform texts cannot, 
however, be doubted. Serious objections have been raised in accepting 
any date for the earliest of the Mba-sQtras beyond 500 B.c. But that it- 
self does not appear to be a reliable ground for making such a suggestion 
in view of a more complete and clear textual statement and several

indications of the derivations of approximate values, embedded in the 
very texts themselves. 

Permutations, Combinations and Pascal Triangle 

Another favourite mathematical pursuit of the Vedic Hindus was in 
the field of permutations and combinations, which was also very popular 
among the ancient Jainas about whose mathematical interests we shall 
speak presently. This interest was undoubtedly activated by the con- 
siderations of the Vedic meters and their variations. There are several Vedic 
meters, e.g. Gayatri, Anu^pibh, Brhatf, Tri^fubh, Jagati, to mention a few, 
with 6, 8, 9, 11, 12 syllables. The Vedic meter specialists were concerned 
with the problem of producing different possible types of meters from those of 
varying syllables by changing the long and short sounds within each syllable 
group. In this effort, they were led invariably to laying the foundation of 
the mathematics of permutations and combinations. Emerging from the 
intricacies of the Vedic meters, these rules found immediate applications, e.g. 
finding possible combinations of the six tastes taking one, two, three, etc., at a 
time,® possible numbers of philosophical categories through combinations of 
n fundamental categories taken one, two, three, etc., at a time,*' total number 
of perfumes that can be made from sixteen different substances taken one, 
two, three or four substances at a time,® and so on. In all these examples, 
the results are given correctly. 

Special importance attaches to Pihgala’s Chandafi-sutra (200 b.c.) 
which contains a method called meru-prastdra for finding the number of 
combinations of n syllables taken 1, 2, 3 ... n at a time. The method, as 
explained by the commentator Halayudha (tenth century a.d.), is as follows: 

‘After drawing a square on the top, two squares are drawn below 
(side by side) so that half of each is extended on either side. Below it 
three squares, below it (again) four squares are drawn and the process 
is repeated till the desired pyramid is attained. In the (topmost) first 
square the symbol for one is to be marked. Then in each of the two 
squares of the second line figure one is to be placed. Then in the 
third line figure one is to be placed on each of the two extreme squares. 
In the middle square (of the third line) the sum of the figures in the 
two squares immediately above is to be placed; this is the meaning of 
the term purna. In the fourth line one is to be placed in each of the 
two extreme squares. In each of the two middle squares, the sum 
of the figures in the two squares immediately above, that is three, is 
placed. Subsequent squares are fiUed in this way. Thus the second 
line gives the expansion of combinations of (short and long sounds 
forming) one syUable; the third line the same for two syllables, the 
fourth line for three syllables, and so on.’**

The meru-prastara is the same as the triangular array known in Europe

JAINA MATHEMATICS 

Despite great interest attached to mathematics by the Jainas of ancient 
India, very httle of their mathematical effort has unfortunately survived to 
this day. We have of course the mid-ninth century mathematical classic 
Ganita-sdra-sarpgraha by Mahavira (c. a.d. 850), but no such comparable 
work belonging to the pre-Christian centuries is extant. We only have a 
few fragments or insertions in canonical or other types of non-mathematical 
literature from which to judge of their early achievements. That a good body 
of mathematical literature must have existed at one time seems indicated in 
Mahavira’s own statement in which he described himself as a mere compiler 
from the great ocean of the knowledge of mathematics from which long 
lines of holy sages had skilfully gadiered many precious mathematical 
gems. About the first century b.c. the Sthdndnga-siitra, a Jaina canonical 
work, listed several mathematical topics which used to be cultivated at 
that time. These topics are: sarpkhydyana (science of numbers), parikarma 
(fundamental operations), vyavahdra (subjects of treatment), rajju (ge- 
ometry, like Mba)y r&ii ^eap, solid mensuration), kaldsavarria (fractions), 
y&vat-tdvat (equations, algebra), varga (square, quadratic equations), ghana 
(cube, cubic equations), varga-varga (biquadratic equations) and vikalpa

(permutations and combinations). The Sanskrit version of the above 
enumeration in Pali runs as follows: 

parikarma rajjuh raiih vyavahdrastathd kaldsavarnasca | 

pudgalah ydvattdvat bhavanti ghana ghanamulaffi vargafi vargamulam || 

These subjects and the various technical terms used by the Jainas 
passed later on into the mathematical works of scholars irrespective of their 
religious beliefs and adherences. It is thus quite reasonable to believe that 
in the period intervening the literature of the Brdhmanas and the Sutras 
of the various Vedic schools and the period of specialization and Siddhantic 
astronomy from about the fourth or fifth century a.d. the Jaina mathe- 
maticians played a significant role. The disappearance of their works 
might be due to (a) supersession of their simple processes and methods by 
better and more sophisticated ones due to Aryabhata, Brahmagupta, Maha- 
vira, Sripati, iSridhara, Bhaskara and others and (b) progressive deterio- 
ration of the culture of mathematics in their religious order. 

Jaina Mathematical Sources 

As to early Jaina mathematical sources, we have already referred to 
the SuryaprajHapti and the Candraprajnapti which, although astronomical 
works, contain useful information about mathematics as well. Like the 
Sthdndhga-sutra, we have stray references of mathematical and astronomical 
importance in canonical works like the Bhagavati-sutra (first century b.c.), 
the Uttarddhydyana-sutra (first century a.d.) and the Anuyogadvdra-sutra 
(first century a.d.). As to persons by name, mention should be made of 
Bhadrabahu (d. 298 B.c.), who had the unusual gift of reproducing from 
memory the entire canonical literature of the Jainas and was befittingly 
called a irutakevalin. He wrote a commentary on the SuryaprajhaptU as 
we know from Malayagiri and possibly a compendious Samhitd known 
after his name. Biihler noticed a work entitled Bhadrabdhavi Sanihitdy but 
it has not been established that it was the work of Bhadrabahu we are 
considering. Umasvati (c. first century a.d.), the reputed Jaina meta- 
physician and author of Tattvdrthddhigama-sutra-bhd$ya was, of course, no 
mathematician but referred to mathematical formulae in his metaphors, 
which indicate that such mathematical topics must have been widely current 
at least among the intelligentsia of his time. Both Bhadrabahu and Uma- 
svfiti hailed from Kusumapura near Patna. Umasvati was also the author 
of a K^etrasamdsa (collection of places) or Jambudvipasamdsa, This title 
belongs generally to a class of works popular among the Jainas, dealing with 
geography and mensuration. The cosmographico-geographical details, the 
elaborate specification of the dimensions of the different dvipas and fantastic 
wsmological theories given in this class of works conceal at the same time 
important mathematic^ information for this early formative period. Finally, 
we have the name of Siddhasena, the Jaina in Var^amihira’s references, 
from which commentator Bha^totpala quoted a number of passages whidi 
show Siddhasena’s interests in astronomy and mathematics. 



MATHEMATICS 


159 


Theory of Number 

We have already mentioned the Jaina interest in the enumeration of 
large numbers. By the conception of iir^aprahelika they suggested a 
number of the order of 8,400,0002®. The Jaina terminology uses the 
word sthana for the decimal place. As to names beyond thousand (sahasra), 
they prefer to proceed as follows: tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, 
tens of thousands of thousands (^o^i), tens of koti, hundreds of kofi and 
so on. In the Jaina system unity is not regarded as a number— gana- 
ndsarrikhyd na upeti. Numbers are classified into oja (odd) and yugma 
(even) as in the Brdhmana system. 

The whole range of numbers is again divided into three groups: 
samkhyeya (numerable), asamkhyeya (innumerable) and ananta (infinite). 
Each group is subdivided into three orders, e.g. the first group (numerable)— 
lowest, highest and intermediate; the second group (innumerable) — nearly 
innumerable, truly innumerable and innumerably innumerable; the third 
group (infinite) — nearly infinite, truly infinite and infinitely infinite. To 
form an idea of the highest numerable (utkfsfa samkhyeya) of the first 
group, one is advised to count one by one white mustard seeds while filling 
with them a trough as large as the size of the Jambudvipa of diameter 
100,000 yojana and circumference 316,227 yojana 3 gavyuti 128 dhanu 
13 J ahgula and a little over.® In the same manner, one is to fill up with 
same seeds other troughs formed by the various oceans and islands men- 
tioned in the Jaina cosmology, and count them one by one. The total 
number of mustard seeds will still be less than the highest numerable. All 
this is stated in the Anuyogadvara-sutra, which then continues to enumerate 
the number-groups of higher orders. If N be the highest numerable number 
as defined above, the higher groups may be represented as follows: 

(N+l) ,..[(W+ 1)2-1] 

(N+\)^ , . . m+i)^ -1] 

(AT+l)* ...[(AT+l)®-!] 

(iV+1)® . . . [(iV+l)i6-l] 

(N+iy^ . . . [(iV^+ 1)82-1] 

(;v+i)82 . . . 

The highest numerable number of the Jainas reminds us of the Alef- 
zero of modern mathematics, and the Jaina imagination clearly went much 
further than that. 

The Jainas are strongly believed to have possessed some kind of 
numeral symbols although it is not possible to say what these forms were. 
The Samavdydhga-sutra (fourth century B.c.) and the PrajMpand-sUtra 
(second century b.c.) mention ahkalipi and ganitalipi in connection with a 
list enumerating the different written characters. The two names suggest 
that in all probability different numeral forms were in use for different 
purposes, ahkalipi being used in engraving and ganitalipi in ordinary writing.

Fundamental Operations, Factors 

Umasvati mentions two methods of multiplication and division of 
which one is the ordinary method now generally followed and the other 
is a shorter operation carried out in successive stages by factors. The 
method of multiplication by factors reappears in the works of Brahmagupta 
and later authors. Sridhara, in his Triiatika, develops the method of 
division by factors. The Jainas are found to have large and complicated 
arithmetical factors. One interesting feature is their frequent resort to 
approximation in dealing with mixed number. Whenever the fractional 
part is less than 1, it is neglected, but, when greater than |, it is replaced by 
““‘y- Thus^lS089 is used in place of 315089|^ and 318315 in place 
of 318314|^. To indicate such approximation, expressions like kiH- 
cidnksadhika (a little more), kiHcidvidema (a Uttle less) were used. 


Mensuration 


Rajju, as we have seen, was the Jaina name for geometry or mensura- 
tion, in which they closely followed the Vedic Mbavids. Of the many 
geometrical terms met with in their literature, the following may be men- 
tioned: sama-cakravala, vrtta (circle), vyasardha, vifkambhardha (semi- 
diameter, radius), jjva (chord), dhanupi'fihu (arc), sama-caturasra (square), 
sama-catuskona (even parallelogram), caturasra (quadrilateral), ayata 
(rectangle), tryasra (triangle), vifoma-cakravdla, parimartdala (ellipse), 
pralara (plane), ghana (solid), ghana-tryasra (triangular pyramid), ghana 
caturasra (cube), gkanayata (rectangular parallelepiped), ghana vrtta 
(sphere), and so on. 

A number of formulae concerning the mensuration of the circle were 
recorded by Umasvati in his TattvdrthSdhigama-sutra-bhSfya andJambudvipa- 
samdsa. These formulae are: 

For a circle of diameter d, circumference p and area a, 
a.= \pd. 

For the segment of a circle of arc a less than a semi-circle, chord c 
sagitta or arrow s and diameter d, ’ 


c = -y/ As(d~s) 

s = iid-y/¥^

varying only slightly in the numerical coefficient of s^. Heron of Alexandria

not appear to have been discovered by him because some of these formulae 
were most likely utilized in earlier texts (Suryaprajhapti, Jambiidvlpa- 
prajHapti) in the computations of the circumference of the Jambudvipa from 
its given diameter of 100,000 yojana, the linear dimensions of the seven 
parts in which Jambudvipa is divided, the dimensions of Bhdratavar^a form- 
ing the southernmost segment of this Dvipa and so on. 

Value of It 

In the relation given above of the circumference of a circle to its dia- 
meter, the value of w is shown to be flO. The astronomical tract Surya- 
prajhapti uses this value as also the less accurate one of 3. In the Uttar- 
ddhyayana-sutra, it is stated to be a little more than 3. But all medieval 
Jaina works systematically used VlO as the value of n in spite of a more 
accurate value having by then come into general use in all Brahmana 
astronomical and mathematical works. 

Laws of Indices 

The power series found in the Jaina works are limited to successive 
squares or square roots, e.g. a\ {a^f, {a^)\ . . . {a% {a^)\ 

. . . (a^/")*. 

In other words, 

first square of a means a^ 

second square of a means a^^^ 

third square of a means ^ 2 x 2 x 2 

«th square of a means a 2 x 2 x 2 x ... to » tenn 

In the Anuyogadvdra-sutra, the world population is given to be a number 
obtainable by multiplying the sixth square of two by the fifth square, or a 
number which can be divided by two 96 times; it occupies twenty- 
nine places, or, according to another interpretation, lies between the twenty- 
fourth and the thirty-second place. According to the definition of the 
square terms, sixth square means 2^* or 2®^ and fifth square means 2^® or 
2®*. Therefore, 

N = 2®®x282 = = 79, 228, 162, 514, 264, 337, 593, 543, 950, 336.

Notice that the figure obtained occupies 29 places and is divisible by two 
96 times. Here we have a clear indication of the application of the follow- 
ing laws of indices : 


Permutations and Combinations 

Statements of results presumably arrived at by the methods of per- 
mutations and combinations appear quite early in the Jaina literature. 
In the BhagavatJ’Sutra, Anuyogadvdra-sutra and the Jambudvipaprajnapti, 
possible numbers of combinations out of n fundamental categories taken 
one at a time {ekaka-samyoga\ two at a time {dvika-samyoga\ three at a 
time (trika-samyoga) have been speculated upon, and possible number of 
selections out of a number of males, females and eunuchs, all calculations 
of various groups to be formed out of different senses, etc., have been given 
correctly. In the Anuyogadvdra-sutra, the number of permutations of six 
things is given by Ix2x3x4x5x6 with further direction of deducting 
2 to give the result less the direct and reverse orders. An English translation 
of the passage runs as follows: 

‘What is direct order? Dharmastikaya, Adharmastikaya, Aka^a- 
stikaya, Jivastikaya, Pudgalastikaya and Samaya— this is the direct 
order. What is the reverse order? (Read the above from Samaya 
backwards). What is AnanupurvI (mixed) order ? In this series, the 
first term is unity, the common increase unity and the number of terms 
six. Multiply the terms one after the other and deduct two. This is 
the AnanupurvI.’® 

Silahka, a Jaina commentator of the ninth century a.d., reproduces 
from some ancient mathematical texts rules for permutations and com- 
binations, with his own illustrations. One quotation, curiously enough, is 
in ArdhmaagadhI. The rules are: 

‘Beginning with unity up to the number of terms, multiply con- 
tinually the (natural) numbers. That should give the result as per 
calculations of permutations and combinations.’ 

That is 

Ar= 1.2.3... (n-l)Az. 

Another rule for finding the actual spread {prastdrdnayanop&ya) runs as 
follows: 

‘Divide the total number of permutations by the last term and 
the quotient by the next. These are to be placed one after the other 
by the side of the initial term in the calculations of permutations and 
combinations.’ 


• Amt. Su., 97 ; see also Chakravarti (G.), pp. 79-88.

The explanation of the rule after Sllahka is as follows: 

(1) The total number of permutations of r things taken all at a time 

= 1.2...(r-l)r = rl 

(2) The total number of permutations having a particular thing for 

Y ! 

its initial digit = y = (r— 1 ) ! 

(3) The total number of permutations in which will be next to 

fl,in(2) =(:^ = (r-2)! 

Proceeding in this way, different permutations of things can be found 
out. 

It must be noted, however, that meter and prosody offered a much more 
fertile field for the exploration of this branch of mathematics and the 
chanda (meter) specialists naturally enough led the way as already noticed 
before. 


MATHEMATICS OF THE PERIOD SECOND TO EIGHTEENTH 
CENTURY A.D. 

This period is characterized not only by the wealth of materials but 
also by the range, depth and quality of mathematical investigations which 
admirably suited the natural talents of this culture area. In the previous 
periods, the problems of architecture, particularly of the sacrificial altars, 
the intricacies of the science of language and commercial accounting stimu- 
lated the development of mathematics, in which also astronomy appears 
to play no mean part. But now the greatest inspiration for mathematics 
came doubtless from considerations of problems concerning the reckoning 
of time. As elsewhere, here in India too, a substantial part of mathematics 
developed as a sequel to astronomical advancement, and it is no accident 
that a sizeable part of post-Vedic mathematics has been found only in 
association with astronomical works. The relationship acted as a feed- 
back process. Problems of accurate positioning of the heavenly bodies, 
description of their motions in longitudes, calculations and explanations of 
true positions from the mean, and several others, called for refinements in 
algebraic solutions of indeterminate problems, many arithmetical opera- 
tions such as handling of large fractions, root extractions and led to the 
emergence of entirely new mathematical techniques of analysis, e.g. the 
methods of plane and spherical trigonometry. Mathematization of as- 
tronomy, in its turn, revolutionized astronomy on a scale by comparison with 
which the Vedic and the Jaina astronomy appeared almost primitive. As 
we have seen, the gestation period of the Siddhantic astronomy, the result 
of such mathematization, may be limited to the first few centuries of the 
Christian era. The commercial factors also played a notable part. 



164

particularly in the development of arithmetic. Expansion of trade and 
commerce, particularly with overseas countries, and the demands of an 
expansive economy doubtless had a beneficial effect on the progress of 
mathematics. 


SOURCES 

The Bakhshali Manuscript {third or fourth century ^ 

We open the discussion of the sources of this period with a manuscript 
whose date has been the subject of much controversy. The manuscript was 
discovered in 1881 in a small village called Bakhshali near Peshawar now 
in Pakistan. Written on birch bark in Sarada script, the manuscript has 
survived in about 70 leaves, some of them in mere scraps. Hoernle® who 
published a number of accounts of it placed it between the third and 
fourth century a.d., a dating with which Buhler, Cantor, Cajori, Datta 
and other scholars agreed. Kaye, who prepared photographic facsimiles 
and translation of the text with a long introduction, considered it to be a 
work not earlier than the twelfth century a.d. and even expressed doubt 
about its Indian origin. From a detailed study of its mathematical contents, 
Datta^ established that the manuscript was a running commentary on an 
earlier work, in support of Hoernl6’s view that ‘there is every reason to 
believe that the Bakhshali arithmetic is of a very earlier date than the 
manuscript in which it has come down to us’. 

The manuscript is entirely a mathematical work containing rules, with 
illustrative examples and their solutions, for arithmetical, algebraic and 
geometrical operations. The major portion deals with arithmetic includ- 
ing fractions, square roots, progressions, income and expenditure, profit 
and loss, computation of gold, interest, rule of three and summation of 
complex series. The arithmetical notation generally employed is the deci- 
mal place-value notation. The algebraic operations discussed include 
simple and simultaneous linear equations, quadratic equations, surds, with 
interesting details as to plan of writing equations, unknown quantities, 
negative signs, the method of false positions and the like. Several problems 
relating to mensuration and miscellaneous subjects have also been dealt with. 

In the selection of topics, methods of treatment, use of symbols, nota- 
tions and terminology, the Bakhshali manuscript presents several charac- 
teristic features by which it is distinguishable from other and more well- 
known Hindu works. While most of the topics discussed are met with 
more or less in contemporary or later works, significant omissions are 
indeterminate equations of the first degree, the Pellian equation and the 
geometry of shadows cast by a gnomon. These omissions have been inter- 
preted as evidence of the more ancient nature of the work. Contrary to a 
majority of Hindu works, the method of exposition followed in it is detailed 
and generally comprises (a) the statement of the rule {siltra\ {b) examples

{uddharana) and (c) demonstration of the operation (karma) of the rule 
or rules in the examples. Most of the original works we know are nothing 
but books of mathematical formulae rarely containing examples which 
are usually left to the commentators. Neither in the original nor in the 
commentaries it is expected of a Hindu tract to provide the demonstration 
or the rationale of the rules, which were the functions of the teachers belong- 
ing to the different schools to explain. 

Aryabhata I (b. a.d. 476) 

In the history of mathematics, Aryabhata occupies a special position 
not only by his appearance at the head of the Hindu mathematical 
renaissance but by the pattern and the tone set by him in mathematical 
investigations to be emulated by the generations of mathematicians to 
follow. His mathematical rules set forth in the highly condensed and 
sometimes cryptic form are given in the Gitikapada and the Ganitapada 
sections of his Aryabhafiya, of which the remaining chapters deal with 
astronomy. 

In his Gitikapada, Aryabhata gives an account of an ingenious and 
peculiar alphabetical system invented by him of expressing numbers on 
the decimal place-value model. Tables of astronomical constants, trigo- 
nometrical sine tables and other numerical data are given in this new 
system. The Ganitapada gives rules, among others, for the extraction of 
square and cube roots by the arithmetical method, areas of triangles, trape- 
zium or any plane figure, circle, volumes of pyramid, sphere, value of tt, 
arithmetical progression, summation of series, interest, rule of three, frac- 
tions, method of constructing sines by forming triangles and quadrilaterals 
in the quadrant of a circle, and indeterminate equations of the first degree. 
Aryabhata gave the most accurate value of w as 3-1416 and used the formula 

• / . 1 \ • • • / ^ V sin /la 

sin (n-f l)a— sin na = sin sin («— l)a 

for the construction of sine tables, a formula also used in the Surya-siddhanta. 
Rule for the solution of indeterminate equations of the first degree is found 
for the first time in his work although the germs of such equations are 
traceable to the sulba-sutras as already noticed. This opened a favourite 
line of investigation among later Hindu mathematicians and developed into 
ajnew branch by its own right. 

Aryabhata was the founder of a mathematical-astronomical school. 
His commentators included, among others, Bhaskara I, Nilakaptha Soma- 
sutvan, Parame^vara, Some^vara, Suryadeva and Yallaya. The first three, 
while following in the footsteps of their great master, also made important 
contributions of their own. 

Bhdskara I (c. a.d. 600) 

Well known for his Mahdbkdskariya, a shorter tract LaghubMskariya 
and a commentary (Bhd^a) on the Aryabhdtiya, Bhaskara I primarily 



166 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


developed Aryabhata’s principles of astronomy. In mathematics, his main 
contribution lies in the field of indeterminate equations of the first degree, 
of which he dealt with many specific cases and gave several examples to 
explain their application in astronomy. He found a method to solve such 
equations with two remainders called dvicchedagra.°' 

Brahmagupta (c. a.d. 598) 

George Sarton describes Brahmagupta as ‘one of the greatest scientists 
of his race and the greatest of his time’. As the first mathematician to 
have attempted successfully the solution of the so-called Pellian equation 
he richly deserves such a reference. Although a critic of Aryabhata, he 
follows the latter in introducing chapters on mathematics in his great 
astronomical treatise Brahmasphuta-siddhanta. These two chapters are 
the twelfth called the Ganitadhyayah and the eighteenth the Kulfadhydyah, 
The former is concerned with 20 arithmetical operations or logistics 
(parikarma), including square and cube roots, fractions, rules of three, five, 
seven, etc,, barter, and eight determinations (vyavahdra), e.g. mixture, 
series, plane figures, excavation, stock, saw, mound and shadow. Accord- 
ing to Brahmagupta’s definition, a mathematician (ganaka) is one who has 
mastered distinctly and severally the 20 logistics beginning with addi- 
tion and the eight determinations ending with the shadows. Ku^ddhydya 
is the section on algebra and deals with the methods of pulverization in 
solving indeterminate equations of the first degree, linear equations with 
one or more unknowns, equations involving products of unknowns, square 
nature or indeterminate quadratic equations. The lemma he discovered 
for the solution of the last-named equations marked the culmination of 
his mathematical genius. Brahmagupta found an able commentator in 
Pfthudakasvamin who lived in the ninth century a.d.; some other commen- 
tators were Araaraja, Srldatta and Bhattotpala. 

MahdvJrdcdrya (c. a.d. 850) 

Mahavira, the great Jaina mathematician, probably hailed from the 
Kanarese-speaking areas of south India and flourished during the reign of 
the Ra§trakuta King Amoghavar§a Nrpatunga (814-877). In keeping 
with the Jaina tradition, he studied mathematics for its own sake and not 
in association with astronomy as was the vogue with the Brahmana mathfe- 
maticians. His Ganita-sdra-scufigraha does not, therefore, form part of 
any astronomical treatise, but treats of mathematical problems in a more 
simple and direct manner. The copious illustrations characterizing his 
work also bear this impress. But he seems to be fully conversant with 
Brahmaija mathematics and, in particular, with the works of Brahmagupta 
whose reputation as an authority was far and wide. In fact, he dealt with 
several of the problems which had engaged the attention of his illustrious

predecessor and tried to improve upon them, often times with success, 
which shows that he was neither a mere compiler nor a commentator but 
an original investigator. From the fact that the manuscripts of his work 
and its commentaries have come down to us in Kanarese and in Telugu 
translations, Bhaskara II and other scholars in northern and central India 
do not refer to his work and it is not even mentioned in Sudhakara Dvivedi’s 
Gamkatarangim, it is reasonable to infer that his work was in circulation 
only in the south. 

Ganita-sara-samgraha is a work in nine chapters, dealing with operations 
with numbers excluding those of addition and subtraction which are taken 
for granted, squaring and cubing, determination of square and cube roots, 
summation of arithmetic and geometric series, fractions, rule of three, 
mensuration and algebra, including quadratic and indeterminate equations. 
His arithmetical operations are based on decimal place-value numeration. 
He mentions 24 notational places and uses word numerals as had been the 
established practice. He gives operation with zero, but erroneously states 
that a number divided by zero remains unchanged. Negative numbers 
are used. The process of summation of a series from which the first few 
terms are omitted is called by him vyutkalita. In his treatment of fractions 
he was the first among the Indian mathematicians to have used the method 
of lowest common multiple, called by him niruddha, in order to shorten 
the process. In mensuration, Mahavira’s treatment is similar in spirit 
with that of either Brahmagupta or Bhaskara II, but much fuller and in 
certain cases a little more advanced. Like Brahmagupta, he gives the area 
of a quadrilateral as 

V (s—a)(s—h)(S’-‘C){s—d) 

but does not mention that it holds good only for a cyclic one. For the 
volume of a sphere, he gives an approximate rule as \{\df and an accu- 
rate one as ^ . I . (W)^, which makes tt equal to 3-0375. 

Mahavira gives two roots for quadratic equations and treats of simple 
and simultaneous indeterminate equations of the first degree. 


Aryabhata II {a.d. 950) 

Well known as the author of Mahdsiddhdnta, an astronomical com- 
pendium based more or less on the orthodox tradition of the smrtiSj Arya- 
bhata II discusses the favourite Hindu topic of indeterminate equations in 
a section called Kuttakddhydya in the 18th chapter of his book. Dealing 
mainly with indeterminate equations of the first degree, he improved upon 
the method by suggesting a shorter procedure. He has also given rules 
for solving quadratic equations along lines given previously by Aryabhata I 
and Brahmagupta. Several arithmetical operations, such as the four 
fundamental operations, operations with zero, extraction of square and 
cube roots, rule of three and fractions, are also treated in this work. 



168 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


SridharUcdrya (c. a.d. 991) and Sripati {c. a.d. 1000) 

grldhara is referred to by Bhaskara II as a distinguished mathematician 
and is quoted by the latter in a number of places. We know of two arith- 
metical works by him-a fuller work under the title Pafiganita and the other 
a smaller tract called Tri§atika, both of which have been edited, and of 
which a number of manuscripts also exist. His algebra is no longer extant, 
but is known from Bhaskara’s references. The same arithmetical topics 
as are discussed by Brahmagupta, Mahavira and Bhaskara II are treated in 
the TriMikd. For multiplication, he uses a new term pratyutpanna (re- 
produced) and discusses the kapdfa-sandhi (door-junction, Gelosia) method 
which became very popular among later Hindu writers and was transmitted 
to the West through Arab works. We know from Bhaskara that Srldhara 
was the discoverer of a method of solving quadratic equations in which the 
two sides require to be multiplied by four times the coefficient of x^. An 
application of this method is also preserved in his arithmetic. iSridhara’s 
contemporary SrTpati is well known for his arithmetic Ganita-tilaka 
commented upon by Siiphatilaka Suri in the thirteenth century. 

Bhaskara 11 {c. a.d. 1114) 

Bhaskara II represents the culminating point in mathematical and 
astronomical investigations in ancient and medieval India. In originality 
and innovations he probably ranks with Aryabhata I and Brahmagupta. 
As a lucid expositor of abstruse mathematical and astronomical rules, he 
was probably unrivalled among his class in ancient and medieval India. 
His whole mathematical-astronomical work, Siddhanta-siromam, is divided 
into four parts, of which the first two the Lildvati and the BJjaganita 
deal with arithmetic and geometry and algebra respectively. The work in 
its entirety as well as in different parts are available in a large number of 
manuscripts which clearly indicate their popularity and wide distribution. 
This is also borne out by a large number of commentaries produced at 
different times, including Persian translations. 

The Lildvati concerned with arithmetic and geometry is divided 
into the following chapters: (i) paribhdsd, (ii) sahkalita-vyavakalita, varga, 
vargamula, ghana, ghanamula, §unyaparikarma, etc., (iii) vyastavidhU traird- 
sika, (iv) mUraka-vyavahdra, (v) iredhhvyavahdra, (vi) ksetra-vyavahdra, 
(vii) khdta-vyavahdra, (viii) ci/i, (ix) krakaca-vyavahdra, (x) rdii-vyavahdra, 
(xi) chdyd-vyavahdra, (xii) kutfaka and (xiii) ahkapdia-vyavahdra. The 
topics in which the chapters of the vijaganita (algebra) are arranged are the 
following: (i) ghana-vivarana, (ii) idnya-marana, (iii) varna-marai^a, (iv) 
karani'vivarana, (v) kuftaka-vivarana, (vi) varga-vivaramy (vii) ekavarna- 
samikarana, (viii) madhyamdharamy (ix) anekayarm-samikaranay (x) aneka^ 
varna-madhyamdharana and (xi) bhdvita. 

Both in his arithmetic and algebra, we find a full discussion on opera- 
tions with zero in which the result of division of a finite number by zero 
is correctly given. His arithmetic does not contain further novelties than 



MATHEMATICS 


169 


what are found in the works of his predecessors, except that the rules are 
more lucid and accompanied by many examples. His algebra is character- 
ized by anticipation of the modem theory concerning the sign convention, 
use of letters to denote unknown quantities and detailed discussions of 
several types of equations, including indeterminate equations of the first 
and second degree. The cyclic method (cakravdla) of solving the Pellian 
equations, Nx^-\-c = y^, described by Hankel as ‘the finest 

thing achieved in the theory of numbers before Lagrange* is due to him. 
His tdtkdlika method of analysis contains the germ of modern calculus. 
From consideration of right-angled triangles and regular polygons up to 
384 sides, he found the value of tt as ^ and also ~ = 3T41666. Some 
of his findings will be further discussed in what follows. 


Ndrayana (c. a.d. 1350) 

There are several authors of the name of Narayana of whom four 
attained distinction in mathematics, astronomy and astrology. The most 
important of them as a mathematician was Narayana Pandita, son of 
Nrsiipha Daivajfia, who flourished during the reign of Firuz Shah (1351- 
1388). He composed two works, one on arithmetic the Gmitakaumudl 
and the other on algebra the Bljaganitdvatamsa. He was clearly influenced 
by Bhaskara II; nevertheless, his works attracted wide notice and became 
quite popular as is evidenced by the existence of a number of commentaries by 
Jnanaraja, Suryadasa, Ganesa and others. His algebra is a work of greater 
merit and is divided into two parts: (i) laws of signs, arithmetic of zero, opera- 
tions with unknown quantities, surds, pulverizer, square nature, cyclic 
method, and (ii) four kinds of analysis, simple equations. In his discussions, 
he clearly follows Aryabhaja, Brahmagupta, Sridhara and Bhaskara. 


The Work of the Commentators 

The centuries following the time of Bhaskara II largely belonged to the 
commentators. This is not to suggest that occasionally works of originality 
were not produced after Bhaskara II or that the period up to his time was 
only one of original investigators. Brahmagupta’s scholiast Prthudaka- 
svamin flourished in the ninth century a.d. and was a distinguished scholar; 
as to works of merit other than commentaries we have already noticed 
Narayapa Pandita and there were many others. However, commentaries 
on mathematical works in a fairly steady stream began to appear from the 
fifteenth century. Gangadhara (c. a.d. 1420), an inhabitant of Gujarat, wrote 
a commentary on the Lildvati with expositions from BhSskara’s Bijaga^ita 
as well. Colebroke used it in the translation of the Lildvati in his Algebra, 
Gangadhara’s brother, Vi^pu Papdita, wrote an arithmetic called Ga^itasdra 
on the model of Sridhara from whom passages were quoted. The greatest 
commentator of the fifteenth century was Parame^vara (c. a.d. 1430), a 
Namputiri BrShma^a from Kerala, who commented both on astronomical 



170 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDU 


and mathematical works and also wrote a few original tracts. His com- 
mentaries include Bhafadipika on Aryabhata, Karmadfpikd and SiddMnta- 
dipika on Bhaskara Fs works, the Vivarana or Lilavathvyakhya on Bhaskara 
n. His other commentaries and tracts mostly concern astronomy. 

During the fifteenth and the following centuries, south India, particularly 
the Malayalam-speaking areas, developed active centres for astronomical- 
mathematical studies. These schools produced such works as Karana- 
paddhatU Ganitayuktibhasa and Sadratnamala which, among others, dis- 
cussed for the first time trigonometrical sine, cosine, tan and it series 
and gave rules for them. While their period of composition has been 
inferred from internal evidence, nothing is known about their authors. 
Karampaddhati was written by a certain Brahmin of the village of Sivapura. 
Ganitayuktibhasa is an anonymous work in Malayalam on arithmetic and 
mensuration primarily aimed at explaining the mathematical portion of 
Nllakantha’s Tantrasamgraha. This Nilakantha Somasutvan (a.d. 1465- 
1545), who wrote the best commentary on the Aryabhafiya, also composed 
several independent works, including Tantrasamgraha, and was widely 
known in the south. 

About this time in western, central and northern India we hear of a 
number of distinguished Brahmana families zealously pursuing astronomical 
and mathematical studies and producing gloss, commentaries and other 
explanatory works. At Parthapura at the confluence of the Godavari and 
the Vidarbha there flourished Jnanaraja (c. a.d. 1503) who wrote a com- 
mentary on Bhaskara’s algebra, but was more well known for his Siddhanta- 
sundara, an astronomical compilation. His son Suryadasa (c. a.d. 1541) 
composed the Suryaprakasa and the Ganitamrtakupika, the former a com- 
mentary on Bhaskara’s algebra and the latter on his arithmetic; Jnanaraja’s 
disciple phun(Jhiraja (a.d. 1541) was also an able commentator on 
astronomical works. 

Gane^a Daivajna (c. 1507), author of the popular astronomical work 
Grahalaghava, hailed from Nandigrto on the Arabian Sea about 40 miles 
from Bombay (Colebrooke put it 65 miles west of Daulatabad). His 
Buddhivilasini on the Lilavati, accompanied by copious illustrations, was 
one of the best expositions of this arithmetical classic. His father KeSava, 
nephew Nrsirpha and cousin Lak§mldasa were all accomplished astrono- 
mers. Another family of astronomers in Mahara§tra was that of Divakara 
of Golagram (lat. 18® N, long. 78® E) on the northern bank of the Godavari. 
Divakara was a disciple of Gape^a Daivajna and in turn trained his five 
sons, Kr§na (b. a.d. 1561), Visnu (b. a.d. 1566), Mallari(b. a.d. 1571), Ke^ava 
and Vi^vanatha (b. a.d. 1578), in astronomy. All of them, particularly Mallari 
and Vi^vanStha, turned out in time to be able commentators. This tradi- 
tion was transmitted and fully maintained for a few generations through 
Kf§pa s son Nfsiipha (b. a.d. 1586) and his four sons, Divakara, Kamala- 
kara (c. a.d. 1616), Gopinatha and Rafiganfitha (c. a.d. 1640). Kamalakara, 
Ac author of Siddhantatattvaviveka (a.d. 1658), besides being well versed 
in Hindu astronomy and mathematics also picked up some Arabic and 



MATHEMATICS 


171 


Persian astronomy and mathematics. Some passages from Euclid’s 
Elements as well as a few astronomical elements from Persian sources were 
incorporated in his Siddhanta and on the basis of these he ventured to 
criticize Bhaskara’s astronomy. His younger brother Rahganatha com- 
posed, among others, a commentary Mitabhdi^m on the Ul&vatu 

Vallala’s ancestors, well known for their interest in astronomy and 
mathematics, had their original home in Elachpur in Madhya Prade^a. Of 
his five sons, Krsna Daivajna [c. a.d. 1565) and Ranganatha (c. a.d. 1573) 
made their mark in mathematics and astronomy. Kt§i?a was a disciple of 
Vi§nu, son of Divakara of Golagram, and rose to be the chief astronomer 
of Emperor Jahangir. He wrote an excellent commentary Navdnkura on 
Bhaskara’s Bljaganita and another work entitled Kalpalatdvatdra on the 
Lildvati. His brother Ranganatha’s fame was based on his excellent 
exposition of the Surya-siddhdnta in his commentary Gudhdrthaprakdhka. 
Ranganatha’s son Munlsvara (b. a.d. 1603), a great admirer of Bhaskara 
II, wrote a commentary Nisrstarthaduti on Lildvati, composed an arith- 
metic entitled Pd^lsdra and a gloss Marici on the Siddhdnta^^iromanL A 
contemporary of Kamalakara, he attacked the latter for his criticism of 
Bhaskara’s astronomy. 


Exchange of Mathematical Learning between the Exponents of Sanskrit and 

those of Arabic and Persian 

We have referred to Kamalakara’s acquaintance with Arabic and 
Persian astronomy and mathematics. The mutual process of Hindu 
scholars assimilating Arabic and Persian learning and Muhammadan scholars 
digesting, reproducing and translating Hindu scientific works had of course 
started much earlier. We have already noticed the effort of Mahendra Surl 
in the fourteenth century to incorporate Persian knowledge in his Yantrardja, 
of which a commentary was produced by Malayendu Surl in the seventeenth 
century. Nllakantha Jyotirvid who flourished in the court of Akbar com- 
piled a Tajik work in which a large number of Persian technical terms were 
introduced. At Akbar’s command, FaizI prepared a Persian version of 
the Lildvati in a.d. 1587. In a.d. 1634, during the reign of Shah Jahan, 
Ata Ullah Rashidi translated Bhaskara’s Bijaganita into Persian. 

Such cross-fertilization of scientific learning between the exponents of 
Hindu scholarship on the one hand and those of Arabic and Persian scholar- 
ship on the other reached its highest point in the astronomical efforts of 
M^arSja Sawai Jai Sing 11 of Jaipur (1686-1743). A distinguished 
soldier, statesman and politician, Jai Sing was equally distinguished as 
an astronomer and mathematician, of which we have already spoken. At 
his orders, Jagannatha (b. a.d. 1652), the well-known astronomer of his 
court, translate Euclid’s Elements into Sanskrit under the title Rekhdganita 
from the Arabic version Tahrir-u-Uqlidas by Na§lr-al-dln at-TfisI. We 
have already referred to his another laudable effort in translating Ptolemy’s 
Almagest under the title Samrdpsiddhdnta, thus making available for the

first time in Sanskrit the entirety of this great Alexandrian Greek’s mathe- 
matical-astronomical classic. Jagannatha and other paijdits in the employ 
of Jai Sing must have prepared translations of several other Arabic and 
European works on mathematics. We know from Hunter that when he 
met a grandson of Jai Sing’s principal assistant (Jagannatha), he saw in 
his possession the translation into Sanskrit of several European works in- 
cluding Elements, a treatise on plane and spherical trigonometry, and 
tract on the construction and use of logarithms of which the inventor was 
said to be one Don Juan Napier.® However, there now exist manuscripts 
of a work entitled Ukarakhya Grantha by one Nayanasukhopadhyaya 
(r. A.D. 1730), which deals with spherical geometry and is probably a 
translation of an Arabic work.** 


MATHEMATICAL CONTENTS OF THE POST-VEDIC PERIOD 

ARITHMETIC 


Decimal Place-value Numeration 

It is well known that the development of arithmetic depended largely 
upon the mode of expressing number. Before the adoption of numerals 
with positive values, its progress was everywhere slow and halting. The 
early advantage, skill and excellence attained by the Indians in this branch 
has been due primarily to their discovery of the decimal place-value concept 
and notation, that is the system of expressing any number with the help 
of either groups of words or 10 digits including zero having place-value in 
multiples of 10. Mathematicians and orientalists are generally agreed 
that the system with zero originated in India and thence travelled to other 
parts of Europe. ‘Our numerals and the use of zero’, observed Sarton, 
‘were invented by the Hindus and transmitted to us by the Arabs (hence 
the name Arabic numerals which we often give them).’® In the beginning 
of the present century a few scholars, notably George Rusby Kaye and 
Baron Carra de Vaux, disputed the general view by questioning the reli- 
ability of Indian as well as Arabic literary traditions on grounds of chrono- 
logical uncertainty. Their objections and criticisms have been adequately 
answered by both mathematicians and orientalists such as Ruska, Datta, 
Ganguly, Das and Clark. But the knowledge derived from the study 
during the last 30 years or so of Babylonian mathematical cuneiform 
texts by Neugebauer, Sachs and others and from recent studies of Chinese 
mathematics by Needham and his co-workers calls for a re-examination of 
the question of the origin and development of the system in India. The 
mathematical cuneiform texts of the old Babylonian period (1600 b.c.) 
provide evidence of the use of a system of numeration based on place- 
value notation on the sexagesimal scale. Neugebauer believes that the idea 
spread to the Greeks and the Hindus and the latter contributed the final

Step of changing the scale from the sexagesimal to the decimal. Needham 
claims that the numeral forms and the method of number writing, as con- 
tained in the Shang oracle bone (1400-1100 B.C.), were based on decimal 
place-value idea. As to the discovery of zero, he credits South-East Asia 
(Indo-China, Java) for it inasmuch as the Hindu culture there ‘met the 
southern zone of the culture of the Chinese*. The ‘emptiness’ of Taoist 
mysticism no less than the ‘void’ of Indian philosophy, Needham thinks, 
contributed to the invention of a symbol for zero. 


Decimal Basis of Numeration and Word-numerals 

We have seen that from the Vedic times the basis of numeration in 
India has been 10. There are ample references to this in the literature of 
the Brahmanas, the Jainas and the Buddhists which, moreover, reveal a 
peculiar interest in the enumeration and naming of large numbers. The 
word numerals and their use in a decimal place-value arrangement represent 
another unique development in India. This system was designed par- 
ticularly to compress a large mass of numerical data in versified mathe- 
matical texts. The word-names were selected from consideration of their 
association with number. Thus ‘0’ meaning ‘emptiness’, ‘void*, etc., was 
denoted by kha^ dkdsa, ambarut ^unya and their various synonyms; 1 by 
earth synonyms, e.g. ksiti, dhard, pfthm, moon synonyms indu, candra, etc. ; 
2 by yama, asvin, dasra, aksi ; 3 by rdma, guna, agni^ etc. ; 4 by veda, samudra, 
etc.; and so on. Coining of word-numerals may be traced to the Rgveda 
and their use without place-value has been found in the Brahmanas, Veddhga 
Jyotisa and some sutra texts. Their use in a decimal system appears in the 
Agni Purdna and in the Panca-siddhdntika. A few examples from the 
Pahca-siddhdntikd are given in Table 3.1. 

In these examples, the word-numerals, although to be read in the verse 
from left to write for the sake of meter, are to be arranged from right to

ascertaining their numerical meaning. Notice also how the word yama or 
pak?a, meaning 2 when used in the unit place, represents the numbers 20, 200, 
2000, 200000 and 2000000 when used in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th and 7th 
place respectively. 

The word-numerals found extensive use in inscriptions and even 
travelled to foreign countries along with the Hindu colonizers. The 
following are some of the typical examples of such inscriptions found in 
Cambodia, Champa and Java: 

(i) Stone inscription of Phnom B^y^n, Cambodia (a.d. 604): 

6 2 5 

rasa - dasra - Marais - hkendravarse = in the year 526 of the ^aka 
king, that is 526 ^aka. 

(ii) Stone inscription of Ml-son, Champa (a.d. 609): 

9 7 5 

nava - saptatyuttarapanca varsa^atdtita iaka-vanlndra - kdlaparimd-- 
mm = in the ^aka epoch 579, that is 579 ^aka. 

(iii) Stone inscription of Kangal, Java (a.d. 732): 

4 5 6 

iakendre tigate ^rutlndriyarasairahgikrte vatsare = in the year of 
the ^aka king expressed by the number 654, that is 654 ^aka. 

We shall presently see that the above inscriptional records were soon 
followed by numerals with zero arranged according to decimal place to 
express 5aka dates. 


Alphabetical System 

In the section Daiagitikd of the Aryabhaffya is recorded a novel 
alphabetical system of expressing numbers with the help of consonants 
and vowels, based on the decimal place-value principle. An English version 
of the relevant verse runs as follows: 

‘The varga letters beginning with ka (are to be used) in the 
varga (square) places and the avarga letters in the avarga (non-square) 
places; ya equals the sum ha and ma. The nine vowels (are to be used) 
in two nine places, varga (square) and avarga (non-square). (Those) 
nine (vowels should be used) in higher places in a similar manner.*® 

In this system, 25 varga letters from k to m have values from 1 to 25 and 
seven avarga letters from ytoh have values from 3 to 10. Their places are 
governed by nine vowels a to au, distinction between short and long vowels 
being disregarded. Thus the expression khyughf means 

khyughr = khu+yu+ghf 

= 2xl(H-l-3xlO*^+4xlO® 

= 4,320,000 


A. Daia, paribhd^ stanza. 



MATHEMATICS 


175 


Despite great ingenuity displayed, the system was not without limitations 
and ultimately failed to receive widespread use, except among the adherents 
of the Aryabhata school. 

About the same time a similar but somewhat improved system of 
alphabetical notations, called kafapayadi, was developed and used in 
mathematical-astronomical texts. The system employs place-value and 
was probably known to Aryabhata. It was used by Bhaskara I, Aryabhata 
II, Parame^vara and others. Its use is also found in the Jaimini-sutras 
of uncertain date. 

Literary References 

Literary works contain several references to the use of zero before 
its appearance in inscriptional records. There zero is expressed by such 
terms as ‘emptiness’, ‘void’, etc. Pihgala’s Chandah-sutra mentions zero 
in the rules for calculating the number of long and short syllables in 
a meter of n syllables. In the Bakhshali manuscript we meet with 
a symbol 0 which has been called sunya (emptiness, void). This has 
been interpreted by Hoernle and Kaye as a symbol for the unknown 
quantity from its use in algebraic operations. But the symbol has also 
been used in the same text in connection with the decimal arithmetical 
notation. Datta^ has interpreted the symbol as a true representation of 
zero whose use for an unknown quantity is also understandable if by it 
we mean the absence of a quantity which should be there. In the Kash- 
mirian Atharyaveda, zero is represented by a dot. The Sanskrit name for 
this zero-dot is §mya-vindu as is clearly stated in Subandhu’s Vasavadatta 
(c. A.D. 600). 

In the Srlvijaya inscriptions of Palembang in Sumatra a dot is used 
in writing the ‘zero’ of the number 605. The early Arab writers on Hindu 
numerals system used a dot to represent zero, for which the Arabic term is 
a^-?ifr or $i-fr. It is easy to see how from such Arabic words Latin words 
for zero, e.g. cijfre, zijfre, zephyrum, eyfra, tziphra^ etc., were derived. Sacro- 
bosco used the word figMra nihili in the full sense of void, emptiness, as the 
Hindus had done before. 

Operations with Zero 

More important is the early realization by the Indian mathematicians 
of the various operations with zero in the mathematical sense. From 
Brahmagupta onwards, mathematical works systematically give rules of 
operations with zero as follows: 

a±0 = a; 0±a^±a; 0x(±fl) = 0 

0x0=0; ^ = 0; ^ (kha-cheda) 

The correct interpretation of the last operation was due to BhSskara II.

Epigraphic and Inscriptional Records 

The epigraphic records of numeral notations in India, of both non- 
place- and place-value, are summarized in Tables 3.2 and 3.3. 

The Kharo§thi numerals found in the A§okan, !§aka, Parthian and 
Ku§ana inscriptions of the period from the fourth century b.c. to the second 
century a.d. are shown in column 2 of Table 3.2. Strokes and crosses 
were used for the first nine digits and symbols for 10 and its higher powers. 
With strokes and crosses and the sign 7 for 10, the numbers were 
built up to 99 on additive principle. The multiplicative principle was used 
in developing symbols for 100 and its multiples 2, 3, etc., up to 9. No sign 
for 1000 has revealed itself so far. Thus

Table 3.3 shows numeral forms used in decimal place-value system 
and found in stone as well as in grant-plate inscriptions. A few typical 
forms have been chosen from more than 30 inscriptional records of such 
numeral notations that have come to light. A circular symbol for zero 
appears in the Gwalior inscription (column 4) pertaining to the reign of 
Bhojadeva in which the verses were numbered from 1 to 26 in decimal 
figures. In another Gwalior inscription (column 5), the date 933 in Vikrama 
Sam vat and the numbers 270, 187 and 50 were given in decimal place-value 
system. The Gwalior inscriptions provide the earliest palaeographic record 
so far known in India of the use of zero in a decimal place-value system. 

For palaeographic records of still earlier dates we have to turn to the 
Hindu colonies of South-East Asia. Decimal place-value numerals with 
a point symbol {^iinya-vindu) as well as a circular symbol for zero have 
been discovered in three seventh-century inscriptions—two at Palembang 
in Sumatra and one in Banka.® These give the iSaka dates 605, 606 and 
608 in figures. Another old Srivijaya inscription found in Saipbdr gives 
the Saka date 605 in the same way. Drawings of some of these figures 
are given below: 

, 3 .^ 

605 608 735 

Khm^rc inscription Inscription of Kota Inscription of PO 

of Sarpb6r Kapur (Banka) Nagar (Champa) 

In Java, two fragments of inscriptions have been found in Dinaya, which 
express the same date in word-numerals as well as in figures having decimal 
place-value. The §aka date 682 is given as nayanavasurasa and also in 
figures. 

From what we know about the development of word-numerals in 
ancient India, their appearance later on in monumental inscriptions in 
association with Saka dates and their subsequent replacement by figures 
with zero in Hindu culture areas of South-East Asia can only lead to the 
conclusion that the numerals with zero had originated in the parent country 
and thence travelled to South-East Asia with the Hindu colonizers. Coed^s 
also arrived at the same conclusion when he said that ‘their (of the numerals 
with zero) use in the Indian colonies at an old date is clearly in favour 
of their existence in India at a date older still* (English translation of 

® Coed^, pp. 323-28.

the French version). It is therefore difficult to agree with Needham® that 
the Chinese decimal place-value system and the emptiness of the Taoist 
mysticism might have stimulated the discovery of zero in South-East Asia. 

Hindu Originality 

The Babylonian origin of the place-value system now appears beyond 
doubt. It is immaterial that they chose a sexagesimal scale. But whether 
the Hindu decimal place-value was derived from the Babylonian sexagesimal 
place-value must remain a matter of conjecture only. The discovery of 
cuneiform inscriptions of the Hittite Kings of Mitanni in Cappadocia 
(fifteenth or fourteenth century b.c.) and the archaeological finds from Ur, 
Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have established India’s relations with Western 
Asia from the third millennium b.c. There are stray instances of Babylonian 
sexagesimal parameters appearing in Indian astronomical texts. But the 
fact that the sexagesimal system was never generally adopted in India, the 
very ancient and long Indian tradition handed down from the Vedic times 
of giving decimal place-names and the various experiments of expressing 
numbers on a decimal place-value plan are still valid grounds for believing 
in an independent Indian origin of the system with zero. 

New Arithmetic 

The development of the place-value system meant the evolution of a 
new kind of arithmetic which Sarton described as a ‘medieval novelty’. 
This medieval novelty represented by algorism, the term used to mean 
arithmetic, came to Europe largely through Arabic translations of, and 
works based on, Indian treatises and influenced in no small measure Euro- 
pean mathematical renaissance. 

Multiplication, Division 

About the four fundamental operations of addition, subtraction, 
multiplication and division, the first two need not be considered. Most of 
the arithmetical works give four and some five or more methods of multi- 
plication, of which the frequently occurring ones are kapdla-sandhi, tastha, 
rupa-vihhaga, sthana-vibhdga, i^td’ganita and the gelosia method. The 
latter is sometimes included also under kapata-sandhi. The first method 
was in common use, of which Sridhara gives the rule as follows: ‘Place the 
multiplicand below the multiplier and multiply successively in the direct 
or the reverse order; move the multiplier after each operation; this is called 
kapdfa-sandhi' This is the same as the modern method followed generally in 
elementary schools with the multiplier being placed under the multiplicand. 

The gelosia or grating method is first noted in Ganesa’s Buddhivildsinl 
Ga^e^ explained it with reference to an example of the Lildvatfi as

shown in Fig. 3.13. The kapdfa-sandhi method is given by such Arab 
mathematicians as al-KhwarizmI (a.d. 825), al-NasavI (c. a.d. 1025), 



al-Qalasadi (c. a.d. 1475) 
and several others. From 
al-NasavI’s reference to the 
method as ta'rikh aUhindi 
and al-amal al-hindf, Indian 
transmission is indicated. 
The gelosia, also known as 
the method of the quadri- 
lateral, the square or the 
cell, appears among the 
Arabs and later on among 
the Latin European mathe- 


1 6 2 0 maticians such as Pacioli (c.

1545). On the question of 

its origin and transmission. Smith observed: ‘It was very likely developed 
first in India, for it appears in Ganesa’s commentary on the Llldvatl and in 
other Hindu works. From India it seems to have moved northward to China, 
appearing there in an arithmetic of 1593. It also found its way into the Arab 
and Persian works, where it was the favourite method for many generations.’® 
The operation of division, particularly the long one, was considered 
the most difficult of the fundamental operations in Europe even as late as 
the fifteenth century. We have Luca Pacioli’s remark, in Smith’s quotation, 
that ‘if a man can divide well, everything else is easy, for all the rest is 
involved therein’. Modern method of division appears in the form of 
rules in the works of Mahavira, Sridhara, Aryabhafa II and later writers, 
but that does not imply lack of the knowledge of it before the ninth century. 
Aryabhata I and Brahmagupta, although they refrained from discussing 
the method, clearly showed easy acquaintance with it in their operations of 
extracting the square and cube roots of large numbers as we shall presently 
see. A method of division by removing common factors was probably 
known to early Jaina writers. 


Square and Cube Roots 

The modern arithmetical methods of extracting the square and cube 
roots of any number appear from Aryabhafa I onwards. Brahmagupta, 
Mahavira, Srldhara, BhSskara II, Kamalakara and others have all given 
the same rules with varying degrees of clarification, and with examples 
y some. Here is Aryabhata Fs rule for the square root extraction:^

which means: 

‘One shall always divide the non-square place {avarga) by twice 
the square root of the (preceding) square place, then subtract the square 
(of the quotient) from the (next) square place; the quotient placed 
at the next place is the root.’ 

Following Parame^vara’s commentary, the number whose square root is 
to be determined is to be divided into two categories of places, square 
iyargd) and non-square {amrga) places. From the last square or odd 
place, counting from right, one should subtract the square of the highest 
root permissible. This root is to be set apart. The next number in the 
even or non-square place on being placed after the previous remainder 
should be divided by twice the root thus set apart. The square of the 
quotient obtained is to be subtracted from the next square place. The 
quotient is a root for the next operation and should be placed in a row 
after the previous one. This is illustrated in the following example:®

The required square root = 345 

For the cube root extraction, we give Brahmagupta’s rule which is the 
same as that given by Aryabhata I before him. 

‘The divisor for the second non-cubic (digit) is thrice the square 
of the cubic root. The square of the quotient, multiplied by three 
and by the preceding, must be subtracted from the next (non-cubic); 
and the cube from the cubic (digit): the root (is found)* (Translation 
after Colebrooke (2)). The steps are explained in the following example :

Special importance attaches to Aryabhata’s rules for the extraction of 
the square and the cubic root because these, through the use of square, 
non-square, cubic and non-cubic places and by the procedures laid down, 
clearly indicate the use of decimal place-value notation with zero in Arya- 
bhata’s time and possibly for a long time before him. These arithmetical 
operations were the direct consequence of the decimal place-value system. 
In Europe, these modern methods do not appear before Cataneo (a.d. 1546). 
Cataldi (a.d. 1613), the author of the Trattato, was one of the first writers 
to use similar methods in their entirety. In the fourth century a.d., 
Theon of Alexandria, the noted commentator of Ptolemy’s Almagest, gave 
a method for approximate extraction of square roots of sexagesimal frac- 
tions, but it was approximate, algebraical and dilferent from the Hindu 
method. In China, methods of extraction of square root {khai fang) and 
cube roots {khai U fang) with the help of counting boards appear in the 
Chiu-chang Suan-shu (latter half of the first century a.d.).® 

Ratio, Proportion and Rule of Three 

Problems of simple ratio and proportion were effectively handled by 
the ancient Indians by the Rule of Three, trairdiika, and the Inverse Rule

of Three, vyasta-trairdMa. Problems involving compound proportions 
were dealt with the rules of five, seven, nine, etc., depending on the number 
of terms involved. The Rule of Three is given in the Bakhshali Manuscript, 
by Aryabhata, Brahmagupta and other writers of arithmetical works, where- 
as rules and cases of compound proportions are met with from Brahma- 
gupta onwards. 

In the Rule of Three, the problem is to find what c will produce when 
a produces by a and c being of the same kind and b being different. Here, 
a is the argument called pramana in the Hindu texts, b the fruit, phaluy and 
c the requisition, icchd. Aryabhata’s rule is: ‘In the rule of three, multiply 
the fruit by the requisition and divide by the argument. The result will 
be the fruit of the requisition.*" Bhaskara II states that the argument 
and requisition must be of like denomination whereas the fruit is of a 
different species. For Inverse Rule of Three, he further says, the operation 
is to be reversed. 

For compound proportion, that is in the method of five, seven, nine 
and more, Bhaskara II directs as follows: ‘Transpose the fruit and the 
divisors; divide the product of the larger set of terms by that of the less; 
the quotient is the result (sought).’^ In such problems, there are two sets 
of terms, one set belonging to the argument and the other to the 
requisition. The fruit term in the argument set is to be transferred to 
the requisition side; likewise, the divisor term, if any, on the requisition 
side is to be transferred on the side of the argument. The remaining part 
of the rule is quite clear. 

The Rule of Three was rated very high among the Indian mathemati- 
cians because, with the exception of squaring, square root, cubing and cube 
root, most of the calculations commonly required involve this rule. Soon 
after its appearance in the West, it began to be described as a golden rule. 
Robert Recorde (c. 1542), the most influential English mathematician of the 
sixteenth century, calls it ‘the Rule of Proportions, which for its excellency 
is called the Golden Rule’. In explaining why it is commonly called the 
Golden Rule, Hodder, an English arithmetician of the seventeenth century, 
says, ‘. . . and indeed it might be so termed; for as Gold transcends all 
other Metals, so doth this Rule all others in Arithmetick’.® Transmission 
of the Rule of Three from India to Europe through Arab intermediaries 
is strongly suspected, for the name is found among the Arab and Latin 
writers. Pacioli (1494) calls it ‘La regola del 3’, Pellos (1492) the ‘Regula 
de tres causas’; Chuquet (1484) ‘La rigje de troys’ and Rudolff (1526) 
‘Die Regel de Tri’ whence its German abridgement ‘ Regeldetri*. 

GEOMETRY 

In the period we are considering geometry did make a progress from 
the point where it was left by the Vedic MbavidSy but it did not develop 
into the type of demonstrative and deductive geometry so favourite among

the Greeks. Analytical geometry, algebraic solutions of rational triangles, 
quadrilaterals, etc., continued to interest the Hindu mathematicians. 

Aryabhata, in introducing a few geometrical propositions, says that 
a circle is drawn by turning, the triangle and the quadrilateral are deter- 
mined by harm (hypotenuse, diagonal), the horizontal is ascertained by 
water and the perpendicular by the plumb-line. The term k^etra-vyavahara 
used by Bhaskara II is interpreted by Ganesa to mean determination of 
plane figures. Plane figures are fourfold, e.g. triangle, quadrangle, circle 
and bow. Bhaskara II gives an aphorism that it is not possible to have a 
rectilinear figure of which one side exceeds or equals the sum of the other 
sides.® 


Triangle 


In two rules of his Ganitapada,^ Aryabhata indicates proportion- 
ality of sides in two similar triangles. These have applications in the 
gnomon and shadow problems. Aryabhafa gives the property of right- 
angled triangles as the square of the bhuja (perpendicular side) plus the 
square of the kofi (side) being equal to square of the karna (hypotenuse); 
that is x^-\-y^= z^. General solutions for sueh rational triangles are 
given by Brahmagupta, Mahavira, Bhaskara and other writers. Several 
rules of the Mba-sutras also envisage solutions of rational triangles. 

The solutions in the form Imn and for the bhuja, 

kofi and the hypotenuse are given by Brahmagupta, Mahavira and Bhaskara. 
Mahavira puts it as: ‘The difference of the squares is the perpendicular, 
twice their product is the base and the sum of the squares gives the diagonal 
of a generated (Janya) rectangle.’ In another set of solution, where the 
side a is given, Bhaskara II directs this side to be multiplied by twice an 
assumed number n and divided by the square of that number less unity to 
get the perpendicular. To obtain the hypotenuse, the perpendicular so 
obtained is to be multiplied by the assumed number and the side is to be 
subtracted from the product. Thus the solutions are:

and

or

The area of the triangle as the product of the perpendicular and half 
the base is uniformly given by all authors. Brahmagupta, Mahavira and 
Bhaskara II further express the area as 

\/s(s^aXs-b){s-c}, 

where s = \{a-\-b^-c). 


Quadrilateral, Trapezium 

Bhaskara II, in one of his aphorisms, states that, for the same set of 
sides of a quadrilateral, there are other diagonals, and so the area of the

figure is manifold, for, in such a figure the opposite angles being made to 
approach, shorten their diagonal and the other pair going outwards lengthen 
theirs.® Mahavlra defines five types of quadrilaterals: (1) samacaturasra 
(equilateral), (2) dvidvisamacaturasra (equi-dichastic), (3) dvisamacaturasra 
(equilateral), (4) trisamacaturasra (equitrilateral) and (5) vi?amacaturasra 
(inequilateral). For an equilateral tetragon {tulyacaturbhuja) of side a, if 
one diagonal d^ be given, the other d^ is given by 

d^ = J4a^—d^. 

The area of such a tetragon is given by ^d^do. For trapeziums, the 
area is given by Aryabhata and others as lh{a-\-b), where h is the perpen- 
dicular and a and b the parallel sides. 

Brahmagupta, Mahavlra and Bhaskara also give the area of a quadri- 
lateral in terms of the sides a, b, c and d and s (where 2s = a-\-b-\-c-{-d) sls 


A = '\/{s—a){s—b){s—c){s—d), 

a result true only for cyclic quadrilaterals, but not for any quadrilateral. 
Brahmagupta states the above result as follows: 

bhujayogardhacatusfaya bhujonaghatatpadam suksmam 


That is, ‘Put down half the sum of the sides four times, reduce (each) by the 
sides, multiply the results and take square root; the exact area (is obtained).* 
Brahmagupta did not limit the result to cyclic quadrilaterals only for which 
the formula holds good. This limitation was realized by Bhaskara II 
who stated that such a rule, though accurate for a triangle, was inexact 
for a quadrilateral. For such quadrilaterals, his diagonals were expressed 
in terms of the sides as follows: 


_ l{ac-\-bd){ad-\-bc) 
^ V abA-cd 

l{acA-bd){ah-\-cd) 

i-j- 


ad A- be 


It is again Brahmagupta who expressed the diagonals of quadrilaterals 
in the above manner. An English rendering of his rule runs as follows: 
‘The sides adjoining each of the two diagonals are multiplied and added 
and (the two sets of results) are divided by each other; the quotients are 
multiplied by the sum of the products of the opposite sides; the square 
roots (of the results) give the diagonals.’*' 

The above results were rediscovered by W. Snell in the seventeenth 
century in Europe. Ptolemy is generally credited with the formula 


pq = ac-\-bd 

which directly follows from the above result. But to Brahmagupta belongs 
the credit of obtaining expressions for the diagonals which easily lead to 
the above formula.

The mathematicians of this period also studied the conditions for 
obtaining various types of rational quadrilaterals. Let us consider the 
question of constructing an isosceles trapezium whose sides, diagonals, 

Suppose p, q and r are 
suitably selected integers. A 
rational right triangle ABE 
(Fig. 3.14) is constructed 
such that 

the diagonal AB = p^+q^ 
the side BE = 
the perpendicular 

AE = 2 pq. 

According to the rule given by Brahmagupta,® the face AD and the base 
BC of the isosceles trapezium ABCD are given by: 

BC = i(^-r)+(p*-92)

The area of the trapezium = pq — rl 

It is clear that all the above elements are rational numbers. This is 
one of the many cases of rational and inscribed quadrilaterals discussed by 
the mathematicians of ancient and medieval India. 


altitudes and areas are all rational numbers.

Circle, n 

In the geometry of the circle, the most important element is the ratio 
of its circumference to its diameter, that is n. Various approximate values 
of TT, we have already seen, had been in use in India from the time of the 
Mba-sutras and early Jaina and Brahmana mathematicians. More accurate 
astronomical computations demanded an accurate value of n for which 
the older values such as 3, VlO, 3-0883 became more and more insufficient. 
Brahmagupta still continued to use 3 as an approximate value good for 
practical purposes and J\0 as the accurate one. But Aryabhata in the 
fifth century had already given a value 3-1416 correct up to four decimal 
places in the following manner:

which means: 

‘Add four to one hundred, multiply by eight and then add sixty- 
two thousand ; the result is approximately the circumference of a circle 
of diameter of twenty thousand.* 


In other words, 

__ circumference __ 8(100 + 4)4-62,000 _ 62,832 _ 3.141^ 

^ ~~ diameter "" 20,000 20,000 

Aryabhata still called it an approximate (asanna) value. This value was 
adopted by Lalla, mentioned by Bhattotpala in his commentary of Varaha- 
mihira’s Brhatsamhitd and finally by Bhaskara II in the reduced form 
^ . Al-KhwarizmI, the celebrated Arab mathematician of the ninth century, 
reproduced Aryabhata’s value in his AlgebrOy almost in the same language, 
which, in Rosen’s translation, runs as follows: 

‘The other method is used by the astronomers among them; it is 
this, that you multiply the diameter by sixty-two thousand eight hundred 
and thirty- two and then divide the product by twenty thousand; the 
quotient is the periphery.’ 


The value of 77 as ^ is met with in Aryabhata IPs Mahasiddhanta^ 
and in Bhaskara IPs Lildvatl This value along with the one reduced from 
Aryabhata’s is given by Bhaskara as follows: 

‘The diameter of the circle multiplied by three thousand nine 
hundred and twenty-seven and divided by twelve hundred and fifty 
gives the near circumference; alternatively, (the diameter) multiplied 
by twenty-two and divided by seven gives the gross circumference used 
in practice.’^ 


The Chinese value ^ of w, given in the Tsu Ch'mg-chih (c. a.d. 370), 
occurs in India in a fifteenth-century collection of rituals, the Tantra- 
samuccaya. In medieval India, a renewed interest in working out still more 
accurate values of tt is noticed among the mathematicians of south India, 
where traditional astronomy had also a new lease of life. In the Karana- 
paddhati, Tantrasanigraha and other works, the values of it are given in 
the form of series, of which the equivalent in decimal is 3T415926535. . . 
Some of the series given in the Karampaddhati are as follows:

For the area of the circle, Aryabhata gives where c is the circum- 
ference, Brahmagupta 2^ for ‘gross’ and for ‘neat’ values and 

Bhaskara II For the area of a trapezium, Aryabhata correctly gives 
the expression ^h(a-j-b). Mahavira’s value for the area of an ellipse is 
2ah-j-h^ as against the correct value of nab. For the volume of the 
sphere, Aryabhata gives or Jn.Trr^ or MlnA Bhaskara 

gives the area of a circle and that of the surface and the volume of a sphere 
correctly as Anr^ and respectively in one rule as follows: 

‘A quarter of the diameter multiplied by the circumference is the 
area of a circle. That (area of the circle) multiplied by four is the 
net covering the surface of the ball (that is the surface of the sphere). 
The surface of the sphere multiplied by the diameter and divided by 
six gives the exact volume of the sphere, its cubic content.’® 



Fio. 3.15 


GaneSa gives simple proofs of the above areas and volume for circle 
and sphere. For any circle, it is first divided into two equal parts and each 
part into a very large number of equal triangular strips by drawing radii to 
the circumference. The semi-circles are then imagined to be stretched into 
a straight line opening at the triangular strips (Fig. 3.15). The two sets of 
triangular strips can then be made to fit into each other so as to form a 
rectongular strip equal to radius x half circumference or nrK Bhaskara 
II, in his Golddhydya, gives a method of finding the surface of the sphere. 
From this the volume of the sphere is determined by imagining the sphere 
to be divided into as many pyramids as there are unit square areas on the 
surface, the height of each pyramid being equal to the radius. The volume 
of each pyramid is ^x radius x unit square area, from which that of the 
sphere becomes equal to Jx radius x surface of the sphere or | 7 rr*. Much

the volume of a cylinder or prism having the same base and height, that

Another relation frequently given by the writers of this period is that 
when a diameter of a circle bisects a chord, the 
product of the two segments {saras) of the 
diameter is equal to the square of the half-chord 
(Aryabhata). That is 

c* = ab.

where d = diameter. 


ALGEBRA 

Terminology 

Algebra, or more correctly, the geometrical methods of solving al- 
gebraic problems, had their crude beginnings in the efforts of the altar- 
geometers of the Vedic times. As a distinct branch of mathematics, it 
appeared from about the time of Brahmagupta. This development was 
due largely to the perfection of the technique of indeterminate analysis 
and to a growing interest in such analysis which found ready applications 
in astronomical calculations. In fact, Brahmagupta used the terms kuffaka, 
kuttaka-ganita for algebra. The term bija-ganita in the sense of calculation 
with unknown quantities (bija) was hinted at by Brahmagupta’s scholiast 
Prthudakasvami, and was used by Bhaskara II. Various terms for the 
unknown quantity are met with in the Hindu mathematical literature, e.g. 
ydvat-tdvaty yadrcchd, mncchd, varna, kdmikOy gulikd and avyakta. 

Equations, Classification, Symbols 

For the equations the various technical terms used were sama- 
karana, saml-karana, sadrsl-karana, etc. The Sthdndfiga-sutra classifies them 
according to the powers of the unknown quantity into the following: the 
simple (ydvaUtdvat), the quadratic {yarga), the cubic {ghana) and the bi- 
quadratic {yarga-varga). According to Brahmagupta’s classification, equa- 
tions fall into the following groups: 

(1) equations in one unknown {eka-varna-sami-karana); 

(2) equations in many unknowns (aneka-varna-sami-karana); 

(3) equations with products of unknowns {bhavita). 



® Br, Sp, Si., xii, 44. 



190 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


This classification is determined by the number of different unknown 
quantities and not by the powers of such quantities. Accordingly, each 
class may include linear, quadratic, cubic or higher power equations. 

For writing algebraic equations it is necessary to use some kind of 
symbols for the unknown quantities, symbols of operations, powers and 
roots. For unknown quantities we have noticed the practice of using a 
symbol for zero or vacant place in the Bakhshali MS. The use of the letters 
of the alphabet is strongly indicated by the use of the word varna (letters 
of the alphabet). Various colour names, c.g. kalaka (black), nilaka (blue), 
pUa (yellow), lohita (red), or abbreviations of the names of precious gems, 
e.g. ma (for manikya, ruby), ni (for indra-nila, sapphire), mu (for muktd- 
phala, pearl), etc., served this purpose. For symbols of operations, yu (for 
yuta) was used for addition, + (possibly from the Brahml symbol for k 
in k^aya) for subtraction, gu (from gum) for multiplication and bha (from 
bhaga) for division. As to powers and roots, va (from varga) directed 
squaring, gha (from ghana) cubing, va-va (from varga-varga) squaring the 
square, that is finding the fourth power, and ma (from mula) finding the 
square root. The following examples from the Bakhshali MS. illustrate 
some of the plans of writing equations:®

Rule of False Position (regula falsi) 

This primitive method of solving simple linear equations of the type 
ax+b = 0, by substituting guess values gg, etc., was in extensive use 
among the Arab and European mathematicians in the Middle Ages. In 
India, its traces have been preserved in the Sthdndnga-sutra in the use of 
the term ydvat-tdvat and the Bakhshali MS. Al-KhwarizmI, Qusta ibn 
Luqa, Abu Kamil and others used the rule called hisab al-khataayn in 
Arabic, which appeared as el-cataym, elchataym, etc., in medieval Latin 
treatises. Smith expressed the view that the rule as used in the Middle 
Ages had possibly come from India. 


Datta (1), pp. 28-29.

Quadratic Equations 

The sulba-sutras contain problems involving quadratic equations of 
the type ax^ = c; ax^+bx = c. The Bakhshall MS. gives the solution of 
a problem in the form which reduces to : 

VB^-4AC-B 
^ 2A 

None of them gives any rule for solving such equations. Both Aryabhata 
and Brahmagupta clearly indicate their knowledge of quadratic equations 
and their solutions. In connection with an interest problem, the Aryabhafiya 
contains the following solution:® 

mulaphalam saphalam kalamulagummardhamulakrtiyuktam | 
mularp mulardhonam kdlahrtam sydt svarniilaphalam || 

which means: 

‘Multiply the sum of the interest on the principal and the interest 
on this interest by the time and by the principal. Add to this result the 
square of half the principal. Take the square root of this. Subtract 
half the principal and divide the remainder by the time. The result 
will be the interest on the principal.’ 

The result may be expressed in symbols as follows: 

where p = principal; t = time; q = sum of interest on principal and interest 
on interest in time t\ x — interest on principal in unit time. 

A similar quadratic solution arising out of an interest problem is 
given by Brahmagupta. Such quadratic problems also arise in finding the 
number of terms in) in an A.P. Both Aryabhata and Brahmagupta give 
the results correctly, which, as Rodet (in the case of Aryabhafiya) pointed 
out long ago, indicate knowledge of the solutions of quadratic equation of 
form ax^4-bx-\-c = 0. 

The method of transforming into a whole square the left-hand side 
of the quadratic equation ax^+bx = c by multiplying both sides by 4a, 
adding b^ and taking the square root is given by Srldhara in his algebra 
which is lost, but preserved in the quotations of Bhaskara II, Jnanaraja 
and Suryadasa. 

The rule is;

That is: 

‘Two sides are to be multiplied by four times the coefficient of 
the square of the unknown; the square of the coefficient of the unknown 
is to be added to both sides; then the square root (is to be taken).’ 

Indeterminate Equations of the First Degree 

This branch of algebra, as we have seen, interested the Indian mathe- 
maticians and astronomers from the time of the Mba-sutras. Detailed 
rules of solution are given in the works of Aryabhata I, Bhaskara I, Br ahma , 
gupta, Mahavira, Aryabhata II, Bhaskara II and later authors and com- 
mentators. Indeterminate analysis had an immediate application in as- 
tronomy in the determination of the cycle (yuga) of planets from the elapsed 
cycles of several other given planets. 

Aryabhata and Brahmagupta gave rules for finding the value of N 
from 

N = ax+ri = by+r^ 

which is the same as finding the solution of the indeterminate equation 
by = ax±(ri-ri) = ax±c, 

where a and b are called the divisors (bhagahard), r^ and rj the correspond- 
ing remainders {agra) and c the difference of remainders (agrantara). Maha- 
vira, Aryabhata II and Bhaskara II chose the form 

_ ax±c 
b ’ 

where a was called the dividend (bhajya), b the divisor (hara), c the inter- 
polator ik?epa), X the multiplier (guna) and y the quotient {phala). All the 
authors have clearly stated that the equation admits of solution only when 
a and b are prime to each other. Methods of solving simultaneous in- 
determinate equations called conjunct pulverizer {sairtilis(a kuflaka) of the 
form

are given by Aryabhata II and Bhaskara II.

The great merit of solving in rational integers indeterminate equations 
of the second degree having the general form

has been traced to the genius of Brahmagupta. Further refinements, 
clarifications and extensions were due to subsequent Indian mathematicians 
such as Sripati, Bhaskara II, Narayana and others including several com- 
mentators who rendered no small service to this branch of algebra. 

The Hindu mathematicians call this type of equations varga-prakrti 
(square-nature), in which N is termed gumka prakrti, x kani?tha pada, 
hrasva-mula or ddya-miila, y jyes\ha-pada^ jyes\ha-mu\a or anya-mulaj c 
k^epOy praksepa or praksepaka. Brahmagupta’s formulation of the equation 
is indicated in the first line of his well-known lemma. 

In clearer terms Bhaskara II defines the equation as follows:® 

i?(ani hrasvam tasya vargah prakrtyd k^umo yukto varjito 
vd sa yena \ 

mulatp dadydt k^epakarp tarp dhanarnarp mularp tacca 
jye^lhamularp vadanti || 

which means: 

‘The square of the optional lesser number (isfa hrasva) multiplied 
by the prakrti and increased or decreased by the positive or negative 
interpolator (k^epaka) gives a square root called the greater root {jye^iha- 
mulay 

That is 

Nx^±.c = jv* 

The method adopted by Brahmagupta and other early mathematicians 
was to find a first set of integral values a and b o^ x and y and form the 
auxiliary equation 

Na^±\ = b\ 

From these an unlimited number of integral solutions can be readily 
obtained by the lemma discovered by Brahmagupta and applied by later 
mathematicians. The Sanskrit term for the lemma is bhdvand, Brahma- 
gupta gave the lemma as follows : 

mularp dvidheslavargadgunakagunddistayutavihmdcca | 
ddyavadhogunakagundh sahdntyaghdtena krtamantyam [| 
vajravadhaikyarn prathamarn prak^epali k^epavadhatulya | 
praksepa^odhakahrte mule prak^epake rupe || 

The above may be translated as follows: 

‘An optional number added to or subtracted from the product 
of the square of a number and an optional multiplier yields a square 
root. (Carry out the operation) twice (and set one below the other). 
The product of the two first or lesser roots multiplied by the 
multiplier and then added to the product of the two last or greater 
roots gives the last or greater root. The sum of the cross-products 


® BBl. Vargi^rakrti, 1.

194 


A CONaSE fflSTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


of the first and the last roots gives the first root. Similarly, the inter- 
polator will be the product of the (two) interpolators. For (finding 
the roots of the equation with) unity as interpolator, divide the roots 
by the square of the interpolator.’ 

Bh§skara II expresses the lemma as follows: 

‘ The lesser root, the greater root and the interpolator being set 
down, other (similar) quantities are to be set down below in order. 
From them several roots may be obtained by the method of 
hhavana. Now bhavana is being explained. The sum of the cross- 
multiplication of the two greater and lesser roots gives the lesser root. 
The sum of the product of the two lesser roots multiplied by the 
multiplier and the product of the two greater roots gives the greater 
root. The product of the interpolators gives the interpolator.’ 

In the next stanza, Bhaskara stales that the rule holds good if, instead 
of the sum, the difference be taken. In algebraic symbols, if Aj, Ci and 
<72, ^2> ^2 two sets of values for x, y and the interpolator of an equation 
of square nature whose prakrti or multiplier is TV, these are to be written 
down as follows: 

Then, at = <7162^^2^1 and y = bib^-^-Naia^ will satisfy the equation:® 

= y^. 

By the method of bhavana or composition, one can obtain an infinite 
number of solutions as stated in the rule itself. In Europe, Fermat (c. a.d. 
1640) was once believed to be the first to have stated that an indeterminate 
equation of the second degree of the type discussed above has an unlimited 
number of integral solutions. The equation with interpolator was mis- 
takenly called Pellian equation after John Pell (1668), the younger contem- 
porary of Fermat. In India, such equations and full methods of solving 
them appeared more than a thousand years before they did in Europe. 

Cakravala or the Cyclic Method 

We have stated that to solve the indeterminate equation of the second 
degree of the type discussed it is necessary to form an auxiliary equation in 
positive integers of a, b and c. Brahmagupta did it by trial and error 
method for values of c = ±1, ±2, ±4. Bhaskara II proposed to solve 
the problem by a method he termed cakravdla and stated it as follows: 
hrasvajyesfhapadak^epdn bhdjyaprak^epabhdjakdn |

The above may be translated as follows: 

‘The lesser root, the greater root and the interpolator are to 
be regarded as the dividend, the additive quantity and the divisor 
respectively (as in the kutfaka). The multiplier (of the kuffakd) is to 
be so chosen that its square less the prakrti or vice versa is the least. 
This (least) quantity divided by the interpolator is the interpolator 
(of the new equation); its sign will be reversed if the square of 
the multiplier be subtracted from the prakrti. The quotient (of the 
kuttaka) corresponding to the multiplier is the lesser root. From this 
the greater root (is obtained). Putting aside the former roots and 
the interpolator the same process is to be repeated (to obtain similar 
sets of values and so on). This is called the cakravala' 

The method seeks to derive from the equation 
ATa^+c = 

the following equation 

j rrfi-N ^ 

Here m is the multiplier such that is the smallest. This multiplier 

is determined by the method of pulverizer {kuttaka), of which the quotient 

is the lesser root. Note how the pulverizer is formed by taking 

the lesser root a as the dividend, the greater root b as the additive quantity 
and the interpolator c as the divisor, as stated in the first line of the rule.® 


Surds 


Operations with quantities like ^2, V3, 7 18, etc. were already well 
known at the time of compilation of the §ulba-sutras. We have seen some 
of the technical terms then used as also geometrical methods of determining 
the approximate values of such quantities. In the second or the third 
century a.d., Heron of Alexandria determined values of surds with the help 
of the following formula: 

JN = a/ a^+r = . 

In the centuries before the Christian era, the Jainas appear to use the above 
relation in obtaining the value of J\0, their approximate value of tt. The 
same formula with higher terms is given in the Bakhsh^I MS. as follows: 


JN a^^r = a’\-~ —

In the form of rule:® 

‘In the case of a non-square (number), subtract the nearest square 
number; divide the remainder by twice (the root of that number). 
Half the square of that (that is the fraction just obtained) is divided 
by the sum of the root and the fraction {samsli^ta) and subtract; (this 
will be the approximate value of the root) less the square (of the term).* 

The following are some of the examples cited for the extraction of the root 
by the above rule: 



According to another ingeneous method due to Narayana Pandita, 
a second degree indeterminate equation (square nature) was first formed 
and solved; the ratio of the higher to the lesser root gave the approximate 
root sought. Let N be the number whose square root is sought. The 
square nature with this number will be 

If a and b be the lesser and the higher root by solution of the above, 

n/A^ = ^ approximately.

‘Find the roots (of a square nature) with the number whose 
square root is desired (as the multiplier) and unity as the additive and 
divide the greater root by the lesser; the result will be the approximate 
value of the square root.*

Brahmagupta and others foUowing them. This branch of study came to

The summation of natural numbers, 1, 2, 3, . . . , formation of triangular 
numbers of different orders and their summation, the summation of the 
squares and higher powers of the natural numbers were also investigated. 
A series of natural numbers is called by Aryabhata upaciti and by Brahma- 
gupta ekottaramekadya. Summation of triangular numbers of higher and 
higher orders is called by Narayana varasamkalita. Thus 

The first yarasarpkalita = 1 -1-2 -|- 3 4 - ... « terms =

Several Hindu mathematicians up to BhSskara II have given the summation 
of both the natural and the triangular numbers, as stated above. In the 
fourteenth century Narayana extended the process to any higher order 
triangular numbers and gave a general formula for the summation up to the 
rth order or the rth varasamkalita as follows:

formula to determining the rth summation of an A.P. of which the first 
term is a and the common difference d. The rth summation of such an A.P. 
up to n terms is given by 

ft — 1

starting with unity.® 

Brahmagupta and Bhaskara 11 have given the summation of the squares

As to geometrical progressions, having the first term a, a common 
multiplier r and number of terms Bhaskara II, in his Lllavatl gives the 
modern rule and several examples. The sum is given by 

r— 1 

The operations to obtain r^ in the formula are rather expressed in an 
involved manner, which is explained in Gapesa’s commentary. 

In the fifteenth century, Nilakantha and some of his contemporaries 
and followers successfully handled the summation of infinite series having 
a common divisor. To Nllakantha was also due the geometrical derivation 
of some of the A.P. formulae discussed above. 

TRIGONOMETRY 

Definition of Trigonometrical Functions 

Instead of dealing directly with the trigonometrical ratios, the ancient 
Hindus dealt with the lengths pertaining to the various elements of an arc 

of a circle of given radius. Their trigo- 
nometrical terminology will be better under- 
stood by referring to Fig. 3.17. 

For the arc AP called dhanu, bow of 
the circle with centre O, PM, the half-chord, 
is called the/yj or ardha-Jyd or jiva, PN or 
OM the kofi-jyd (also called kojyd) or the 
Jyd of the arc complimentary to AP and 
MA, the difference between the radius and 
the kofifyd, is called the utkrama (reversed)- 
Jyd, Expressed in terms of sines and cosines 
as per modem definition.

In Varahamihira’s summary of the Puli§a-siddhdnta, the values of

respectively, from which those of sin 30, sin 45 and sin 60 follow correctly. 
Some of the trigonometrical relations given in the early medieval astrono-

Sine Table 

The various relations connecting the sine of any arc with their multiples 
and submultiples were given with a view to constructing or calculating sine 
tables for different arcs generally lying between 0 and 90°. The Hindu 
planetary theories, as we have seen in the section on astronomy, required 
such tables for computations of true planetary positions. The general 
formula shown against the name of Aryabhata and the Surya-siddhanta 
was used for computing the tables of j'yd or half-chords in a quadrant divided 
into 24 equal parts so that the smallest arc equals 3° 45' or 225'. Since 
the Hindu sines are not the ratios of the corresponding half-chords and 
the radius, but represent the half-chords themselves, their values obviously 
depend upon the length of the radius chosen. The values of the radius 
adopted by Varahamihira, Aryabhata and Brahmagupta are 120 ', 3438' 
and 3270' respectively; other writers have used such values as 150', 3415' 
and 1000'. The values of 24 sines as given in the PancasiddMntikd and the 
Aryabhafiya are given in Table 3.4. From the half-chords given in the 



200

texts, the sines of the angles are computed, which may be compared with 
the modem values given in the last column. The accuracy of the Hindu 
half-chord tables is quite obvious.

Bhaskara I, Brahmagupta, Bh5skara IT, Narayai)a and others have 
given a formula, in different forms, for the calculation of the half-chord 
directly from the given arc, i.c. the angle. Expressed in modem terms, the 
formula is 


R sin Q 


4i? ^(180-0) 
40500 - 0 (^ 180 -^)* 


MATHEMATICS 


201 


where R is the radius, e any angle. Bhaskara I’s rule is as follows:® 

‘The given arc (^) in degrees is to be subtracted from the degrees 
of the half-circle (180°) and the remainder multiplied by the arc. The 
result is to be set down at two places. This result (at one place) is to 
be subtracted from 40500. Divide by one-fourth of this remainder 
the result (set down at another place) and multiply by the maximum 
value of the sine (that is radius). Thus is obtained the direct or 
the reversed sine of an arc and its complement approximately.’ 


Trigonometrical Series 

We have noticed the development of an interest in series and their 
summation in higher and higher orders, the varasamkalita. The process 
was applied to the arc of a circle to obtain expressions of infinite series for 
TT, and trigonometrical functions sin 0, cos 6 and tan 6, In 1835, C. M. 
Whish first drew the attention of modem scholars to the existence of some 
of these series in the medieval astronomical-mathematical works Karana- 
paddhatU Tanirasamgraha, Yuktibha^d and Sadratnamald. The series and 
their rationales have been recently studied more closely. The originality 
exhibited by these Hindu mathematicians and astronomers in handling 
along traditional lines series which occupied much later the attention of 
mathematicians like Roberval (a.d, 1634), Gregory (a.d. 1671) and Euler 
(a.d. 1739) is a clear indication that, at least in mathematics, the decline 
was not complete after Bhaskara II. The KaranapaddhatU now believed 
to be written by one Putumana Somayajin in the fifteenth century a.d., 
gives rules from which the following series can be derived: 


4 ^ 7"h9 

^ 03 ^5 

sin 0 = 0— ^+jy— . . . 
cos^ = l-|y+l4 -••• 


0 = tan 0— I tanS 0-f | tan® 0— . . . 

The series are more neatly described by Nllakantha (c. a.d. 1500) in 
his TantrasarngrahOy while their demonstrations are given in the Yuktibhd^d 
(c. A.D. 1639), a commentary in a highly Sanskritized form of Malayalam 
of the Tantrasarngrahafi The Sadratnamald where these series are discussed 
is a nineteenth-century work.

necessitated handling of spherical triangles and their solutions. Although 
there is no exclusive work dealing with the properties of spherical triangles 
and the relations of their various elements, their properties and relations 
have been correctly applied in connection with several astronomical prob- 
lems. This itself is a good evidence of the early appreciation by the 
Hindus of this branch of mathematics and its effective use in their favourite 
pursuit of astronomy. The following principal formulae for solving spheri- 
cal triangles readily emerge from a series of astronomical rules scattered in 
the texts : 

(i) cos u = cos cos c+sin b sin c cos A 


(ii) cos y4 sin c = cos a cos h— sin a cos h cos C 


(iii) 


sin n __ sin b _ sin c 
sin >4 ” sin sin C 


where A, B and C are the angles of a spherical triangle, of which the op- 
posite sides are a, h and c respectively. Since the Hindus did not deal with 
angles, but with lengths, their results were obtained with reference to 
suitable plane right-angled triangles in which the properties of similar 
triangles were frequently pressed into service. As an illustration, the 
problem of finding the rising times of the different signs of the ecliptic on 
the equator above the horizon may be considered. This reduces to finding 
the relationship between the longitude A (polar longitude in Hindu as- 
tronomy), the obliquity c and the declination 8 of a planetary body on the 
ecliptic. The rule given by Aryabhata and others may be represented as 
follows; 

_ . „ sin A . i? sin € 


V 



In Fig. 3.18, t 6 and yC are portions of 
the equator and the ecliptic, y the first 
point of Aries, c the obliquity, S the 
position of the planet, and CK, Sm and 
Sn are normals to Og, OM and Oy 
respectively. Then, from the properties 
of similar triangles, COK and Snm, 

Sm_CK 
'Sn OC ' 

Now, Sm = R sin 8; Sn = R sin A; 
CK= Rsin e; OC = R. 

Whence, 

„ . ^ i? sin A . /? sin € 

sin 8 = 

K 

or sin 8 = sin A sin e. 


a relationship which follows directly from the spherical triangle ySM by 
the application of relation (iii). Transformation of polar coordinates

into celestial longitudes and latitudes, relations between hour angles, 
azimuth and zenith distance and several others offer further examples of 
the application of spherical trigonometry to astronomical matters and in 
all cases the rules are given correctly in the Hindu astronomical texts. 


CALCULUS 


We have seen that the usual Hindu method in finding the area of a 
circle or the volume of a sphere consisted in dividing the area or the volume 
into a large number of small elements and then taking their sum. Bhas- 
kara II, in particular, had recourse to this method as we have it from the 
exposition of his scholiast GaneSa. In the case of the sphere, the entire 
volume used to be divided into a large number of pyramids of the same 
height equal to the radius of the sphere. The apex of each pyramid co- 
incides with the centre, and the base lies on the surface. The base of each 
pyramid was taken to be a unit of the scale by which the area of the surface 
of the sphere was reckoned. The volumes of these pyramids were then 
summed up to obtain the volume of the sphere. Rudiments of integration 
are clearly noticeable in such methods. 

Ideas of differentials, that is infinitesimal increase of a variable quantity 
due to infinitesimal increase in another quantity, are implicit in Bhaskara 
IPs treatment of the instantaneous motions of planets. In his Siddhanta- 
siromani, he defines two kinds of planetary velocities, the gross or rough 
velocity (sthiild gati) and velocity at an instant of time {suksma or tdtkaliki 
gati). In the former, change of longitude over a long interval of time is 
considered and the gross velocity is found by dividing the change in longi- 
tude by the time interval. To find the tdtkaliki gati, it is necessary to find 
an infinitesimal change in longitude, dX, corresponding to an infinitesimal 
time interval, dt. 

That Bhaskara II also carried out such differentiation is clearly indi- 
cated in his correct formulation of the expression for the tdtkaliki gati. 
His rule runs as follows:® 

‘To find the instantaneous velocity (in longitude) of the planet, the 
kofiphala is to be multiplied by the time rate of change of anomaly and 
divided by the radius, and the quotient (thus obtained) is to be added 
to or subtracted from the velocity of the mean planet according as its 
position is in the six signs from the beginning of Cancer or of Capricorn.’ 


The above rule can be expressed in modem mathematical notations 
as follows: 


dt dt^ R 


.('• 


. doL 
cos«).^ 


where A = tme longitude, X = mean longitude, a = anomaly, r = eccen- 
tricity or radius of the epicycle, r cos a = kofiphala and R = radius of the 
deferent circle.

STUDY OF ARABIC AND PERSIAN MATHEMATICS IN INDIA 

The various Muhammadan houses and dynasties that ruled over ex- 
tensive tracts of India in the medieval times not unoften patronized 
science and learning among their subjects. The contents of science and 
learning, it is needless to say, were what their Arabic and Persian masters 
of West and Central Asia had written about. Moreover, for a long time 
after the consolidation of Muhammadan rule in India, such Arabic and 
Persian science and learning remained confined to Muslim circles of learners 
and scholars, and it was not until quite late that such learning began to 
cross-fertilize the traditional sciences which the Hindus continued to culti- 
vate among themselves. This is not to suggest that one group did not 
show any interest in the science and literature of the other. But the in- 
stances of an al-BirunI zealously exploring Hindu works of science and 
literature, comparing and contrasting them with those of the system he 
represented, or of a Jagannatha mastering Arabic and Persian and as- 
sidously translating difficult astronomical and mathematical texts into 
Sanskrit were rare. For the most part the Hindus remained content with 
the works and commentaries of their learned traditional authors and the 
Muhammadans hardly felt the need of mastering the language and the 
sciences of the former. 

As to promotion and patronage of learning, Sultan Mahmud of the 
House of Ghazna did much to develop Muhammadan learning through the 
establishment of ‘a university supplied with a vast coUection of curious 
books in various languages. It contained also a museum of natural 
curiosities’.® Qutb-ud-din, of the ‘Slave’ Dynasty, himself proficient 
m Arabic, Persian and sciences, established several mosques which, 
like Chri stian churches of Medieval Europe, acted as centres of religion

and secular learning. Of the Tu^uq kings, GhiySsuddIn built many 
public buildings for educational purposes, and provided for stipends 
to learned men; Muhammad was sl^ed in logic, medicine, astronomy and 
mathematics and Greek philosophy; Ftruz established at Firuzabad a 
Madrasah after his name, which, in the beauty of its architecture and 
scholarly reputation, surpassed all other Indian Madrasahs of the time.® 
Firuz also showed considerable interest in Sanskrit technical literature and 
caused a few of them to be translated into Persian. Hindu astronomers 
also received encouragement in his court. Sultan Sikandar Lodi’s reign is 
important in the literary and scientific history of India in the fact that during 
his time the Hindus seriously took to the study of Persian in which, as 
Blochmann observes, they soon attained a great proficiency and even caught 
up with the Muhammadans in literary excellences. 

In the south, Firuz Shah of the Bahamani Kingdom was a great scholar 
and patron of science and learning. He was fond of geometry and botany, 
among the scientific subjects, used to invite to his court learned men from 
abroad, and caused an astronomical observatory to be built (a.d. 1407) 
on the summit of a pass near Daulatabad. 

With the establishment of the Mughal power in India, the Samarqand 
school of mathematicians and astronomers began to play a prominent part 
in the study of mathematics and astronomy among the Muhammadans in 
India. This is clearly mentioned by Babur himself in his Memoirs. 
Humayun had a great liking for astronomy and geography and caused 
terrestrial and celestial globes to be constructed for the purpose. The 
enlightened rule of Akbar was also marked by considerable progress in 
secular learning in which the sciences were not neglected. It was during 
his reign that Lilavaii was translated into Persian. In the educational 
system introduced in his time the study of mathematics received due em- 
phasis among the sciences which used to be taught in the following order: 
morality, arithmetic, accounts, agriculture, geometry, astronomy, art of 
government, physics, natural philosophy and mathematics. The library of 
FaizI which, after his death, was transferred to the King’s library, contained 
4,600 volumes covering different disciplines such as medicine, astrology, 
astronomy, geometry, philosophy, philology, theology, poetry and music. 


ARABIC AND PERSIAN MATHEMATICAL WORKS OF NON-INDIAN 
ORIGIN USED IN INDIA IN MEDIEVAL TIMES 

It is pertinent to ask what authorities and which mathematical works 
in Arabic and Persian used to be taught and studied in medieval India. 
In the present state of our knowledge, a satisfactory answer cannot be given 
to this question, but a good idea may be obtained from the availability 
of manuscripts of a number of Arabic versions of Euclid’s Elements and its

commentaries, geometrical works of Archimedes and several standard 
treatises on arithmetic and algebra in different libraries in India.® 

Thus we have in the Bankipur library the Shari} Uqlidas, a critical 
commentary on Euclid’s Elements in Arabic by Al^nad b. ‘Umar at- 
Karablsi (c. a.d. 840), a distinguished mathematician of the Middle East 
and author of several works. Of the several works produced by Abu-1- 
Hasan Thabit b. Qurra (d. a.d. 901), a few noticed in Indian libraries 
include the Kitdb Arshmldas fi*d-DawaHrVUMutam&ssah, the KMb Arshimi- 
das fl Usuiri Handasah, both geometrical works by Archimedes, and the 
Uqlidas. Thabit b. Qurra, besides being a physician, mathematician 
and astronomer of repute, was one of the greatest translators from Greek 
and Syriac into Arabic. In mathematics his favourite originals were the 
works of Apollonius, Archimedes, Euclid and Ptolemy. His works revived, 
in particular, the study of parabolas, paraboloids and amicable numbers! 
Mention may be made of Ar-Risalah fi Ama'l-Ashkala Kullahd mina'd- 
Da'irah, a work on the geometry of circles by Na§r. b. ‘Abdullah (c. tenth 
century) who flourished in Baghdad. 

Next we turn to Abu Bakr M. b. Hasan al-Karkhi (d. c. a.d. 1019 to 
1029), a contemporary of ^lidharacarya, and one of the greatest Muslim 
mathematicians. A copy of his famous algebra Kitab al-Fakhrl fid-Ifisdb 
JabrA-Wa'l-Muqdbilah has turned up in the library of the Osmania Uni- 
versity. Largely based on Diophantos, aUFakhrl deals with quadratic 
equations and equations of higher powers of the type 

x2«-f = by 

of which he was the first to have given the solutions. He gave the sum- 
mation of the squares and the cubes of natural numbers as follows:^ 





Unlike other Arabic mathematical works al-Karkhi’s were free from Hindu 
elements. 

Of al-Blrunt’s (973-1048) mathematical works we possess his al-kitSb 
fl Istikhraji’l-Autar fi’d-Dffirah bi-KhawassVl-Kha({i'l Munhmi'l-Waqi'fihd, 
a treatise on the chords of a circle, al-Maqalah fi Rashikali’l Hind, aii 
arithmetical work on the rule of proportions based on Hindu works, and 
RiySdatu'l-Fikr Wa'l-Aql, a general work dealing with typical mathematical 
problems. Al-Birunl’s refinements in trigonometry and his construction

of accurate sine tables from 0° to 90® at the intervals of 15' are well known. 
In this connection he also gave several trigonometrical relations. Accord- 
ingly, a special importance attaches to his treatise on the chords among 
the Indian collection of his mathematical works. 

The same is true of ‘Umar b. IbrShim al-Khayyaml’s MaqSlah fl~U 
Jabr-i (c. a.d. 1110), one of the greatest medieval works on algebra. Im- 
portant features of ‘Umar’s algebra are: an admirable classification of 
equations, geometric and algebraic solutions of quadratic and higher power 
equations, development of binomial series with positive integral exponents, 
geometrical postulates, etc. His classification of equations was based on 
the number of terms, e.g. trinomial, quadrinomial, etc. He made significant 
contributions to the solution of cubic equations which he arranged in 27 
groups. The following are a few examples of his quadrinomial cubic 
equations: 

x^-\-bx^ = cx+d 
= bx^-\-d 

x^-\-d = bx^-\-cx 

‘Umar solved the above types of equations by finding the intersection of 
the conics. Such geometrical methods of solving algebraic equations paved 
the way for the development of analytical geometry at the hands of Des- 
cartes in the seventeenth century. In Europe, Renaissance mathemati- 
cians like Scipio del Ferro (1465-1526), Tartaglia (1500-57) and Cardano 
(1501-76) succeeded for the first time in solving cubic equations. 

An arithmetical treatise GhunyatuU-Hussdb fl "llmVbHisdb by Ahmad 
b. Thabit (c. twelfth century) who flourished somewhere in the Middle East 
is noticed in the Bankipur collection. The work deals with multiplication, 
division, ratio and proportion, extraction of roots, transactions, mensura- 
tion and excavation problems. Treatment of conic sections forms part of 
his mensuration. The author’s another arithmetical work was 'Umdatu'r- 
Rd'id. 

Abu Ja’far Na§lr-al-dln al-Hasan at-jusl (1201-74) of Khorasan, 
the celebrated mathematician, astronomer and founder director of the 
Maragha Observatory, was the most popular authority among the Muham- 
madan scientific circles, particularly in the days of the Mughal rule. His 
Tahrir-u Uqlidas, Arabic version of the Elements, is available in manuscript 
copies in several libraries, being published from Calcutta in 1824. TahrJr, 
as Thomas Heath pointed out, was not a translation of Euclid’s 
text but a rewritten Euclid based on the older Arabic translations.® 
Jagannatha’s Sanskrit translation was based on this Arabic version. His 
other works of which manuscript copies have been found in India 
include Maqdlah-i-ArshfmJdas fl TaksJrVd-Da'irah and Kitdbu'bKurah

Finally we shall mention two works, both on arithmetic, of which 
several copies are available in Indian libraries. The ‘ Uyun'l Hisab by Zainu’l- 
‘Abidin (c. a.d. 1460) treats, among others, of the arithmetic of whole 
numbers, fractions, mensuration, solution of unknown quantities by the 
method of Khafa'ain and algebra. Baha’u’ddln al-‘AmulI (1547-1621) of 
Iran wrote an excellent arithmetic Khuld^atu'l-Hisdb, of which several 
copies are available in Indian libraries. The work was published from 
Calcutta in 1862, the Arabic text with a German translation by 
Nesselmann appeared from Berlin in 1843 and a French translation 
by Marre from Rome in 1864. 


WORKS BY INDIAN MATHEMATICIANS 

The rich storehouse of Arabic and Persian mathematical literature 
was thus available to the Indian Muslims for a long period of time. They 
had also access to Hindu works in Arabic translations and commentaries 
as well as in their originals whenever they cared for them. But their own 
production, either in the form of original work or commentaries, appears 
far from impressive. Only from the sixteenth century do we notice some 
degree of activity resulting in the production of a few commentaries and 
translations. 

In 1555, Abu Ishaq b. ‘Abdu’Uah, a mathematician of Golkonda, wrote 
SharMsh’Shamsiyah as a commentary on an arithmetical work ash-Shamsh 
yah by Hasan an-Nishapurl, a pupil of at-ThsI. In 1587, Abu’l-Faiz FaizI, 
the poet laureate of Akbar, translated the Lildvati into Persian. For a 
Persian translation of Bhaskara’s Bljaganita, the Muslim scholars had to wait 
for about half a century. In 1634-35, ‘Atau’Uah RashidI, son of Ustad 
Ahmad Nadir, who took part in the construction of the Taj, rendered this 
service. Mir M. Hashim b. Qasim al-Husaini wrote a commentary entitled 
Shark TaJmr-u-Usuiri-Handasah Wa'UHisdb on at-TusI’s geometrical work 
Tahrlr-u-U0i (1635). Baddi'ul-Kanun (1663-64) by MedhnI Mai b. Dhram 
Das Narain b. Klliyan Mai Kaysth is an arithmetical treatise based on 
Bhaskara’s LJldvatl In 1684, Ismatu’llah as-Saharanpurl wrote a treatise 
entitled Jpdbif QawdUdul-Hisdb in which both arithmetical and algebraic 
problems were treated. Bahau’ddin al-Amuli’s arithmetic Khuld^atu'l-Hisdb 
was commented upon in the seventeenth century by Lutfu’Uah Muhandis in 
his Shark Khuldsatu'l-Hisdb and in the eighteenth century (a.d. 1770) by 
Amlnu’ddln al-Lahorl in his Lawdmi'ul-Lubdb fi Shark Khuld^atu'UHisdb, 
Towards the end of the eighteenth century (a.d. 1797) Faridu’d-Din Ahmad 
Khan Bahadur, Superintendent of Madrasah ‘Aliyah and holder of important 
political appointments, wrote a work on geometrical compass entitled Dar 
$an*ati-Parkdr Ma'Fawd'iduU-Afkdr,

INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIAN AND GREEK, ARABIC AND CHINESE 
MATHEMATICS AND THE PART PLAYED BY INDIAN MATHEMATICS 
IN EUROPEAN RENAISSANCE 

Situated geographically in the centre of the old world, India was from 
the beginning destined to play an important role in the transmission and 
diffusion of scientific ideas. In this diffusion mathematics formed no 
exception. Commercial and cultural contacts of India with Western Asia 
and Egypt extend to prehistoric times. The Persian Empire under Darius 
served as a bridge between India and Western Asia with its numerous settle- 
ments of the Ionian Greeks. Alexander’s invasion and the founding of 
the Bactrian Greek kingdoms on the borders of, and within, India provided a 
further opportunity of intensification of East-West relationships. Ptolemy’s 
Alexandria evinced great interest in establishing commercial contacts with 
India, an interest which was transformed into a practical reality through 
Rome’s eastern policies. The Sino-Indian intercourse depended partly on 
the thriving trade along the silk roads, but largely on the spread of Buddhism 
into China. The rise of Islam and its bid for political and intellectual 
supremacy provided yet another opportunity for the appreciation of Indian 
sciences, particularly mathematics and astronomy, in West Asia, North 
Africa and in Spain. 

The Indian emphasis on arithmetic and algebra is often contrasted 
with the Greek preoccupation with geometry. Nevertheless, the close 
similarity between the philosophical and mathematical writings of 
Pythagoras and his school on the one hand and the Vedic Hindus on the 
other has never failed to attract the attention of scholars. Leopold Von 
Schroeder, in one of his exhaustive studies, tried to show Pythagoras’ 
indebtedness to India in respect of (1) his doctrine of transmigration and 
metempsychosis, (2) irrational numbers, (3) the theorem known after his 
name and (4) the doctrine of five elements.^ Regarding Pythagorean 
geometry and irrational number, Schroeder held the view, shared by Garbe, 
Hopkins and Macdonell, that the square relation among the sides of a 
right-angled triangle and the concept of irrational numbers ultimately had 
their origin in the iulba-sutras of Baudhayana and Apastamba. Others, 
notably Keith, have disputed such views. 

As to Sino-Indian intercourse in mathematics, the catalogue of the 
Sui dynasty listed a number of Brahmanical works, such as Po-lo-min 
Suan-fa (Bramaijical methods of calculations, in 3 books), Po-lo-min-wen- 
ching (Brahmai;iical astronomy, in 21 books) and a number of similar Hindu 
astronomical tracts already referred to. The establishment, in the seventh 
century a.d., of an Astronomical School or Board in Chang-Nan for the 
propagation of Brahmanical astronomy and the reform of the calendar 
after the Hindu model, played an important part in transmitting Hindu 
mathematics in China. In the eighteenth century, during the Thang times, 
Ch’u-t’an Hsi-ta (Chinese version of Gautama Siddha or Siddhartha), 


Sen(S. N.) (3), pp. 8-30.

translated a Sanskrit calendar under the Chinese title Chiu-Chi-li in which 
were discussed, among others, the Indian decimal notation and arithmetical 
rules. It is further on record that the Tantric-Buddhist astronomer 
I-hsing was ordered by the emperor to investigate the chronological and 
arithmetical ideas introduced to China from India by Ch’u-t’an Hsi-ta. 
Sarton observes; ‘The Chinese treatises of Ch’u-t’an Hsi-ta and I-hsing are 
of special value as witnesses of the penetration of Hindu mathematics 
into China. It is possible that the Hindu numerals were introduced 
into China at this time, though we have no positive evidence of it.’® 
Writing about the arithmetical computations employed by Hsi-ta in his 
calendrical work, Mikami informs us that the technical terms used 
therein ‘were so peculiar that the Chinese scholars who are ever fond 
of following conservative tendencies were little able to understand its 
contents’.^ He further observes: ‘The employment of the symbol 0 for 
zero or for the digit that is wanting was probably derived from this 
translation of an Indian calendrical treatise, or from some other Indian 
source. This employment does not, however, occur until the middle of 
the thirteenth century, so far as we are informed.* Studies in other areas, 
such as the problem of the circle-measurement and accurate determination of 
the value of tt, appear for the first time in China after her contact with 
Indian civilization. 

Kaye has cited a number of parallel examples occurring simultaneously 
in the Chinese and the Indian mathematical texts. The Chinese arith- 
metical classic, Chiu Chang Suan Shu (Arithmetic in Nine Sections) (second 
century b.c.), gives the area of the segment of a circle in a form which is 
also found in Mahavira’s work (c. a.d. 830). The following problem on right- 
angled triangle given in the same work appears in Hindu works after the 
sixth century a.d.: ‘There is a bamboo 10 feet high, the upper end of 
which being broken reaches to the ground 3 feet from the ground. What 
is the break?* The remainder problem, without any rule for solution, 
appears in the Sun-Tzu Suan-Ching, another arithmetical classic (fourth or 
filth century a.d.), a little earlier than such examples are met with in the 
Indian texts. The rules for solving such remainder problems, or what is the 
same thing as the solution of indeterminate equations of the first degree, 
appear in Indian texts from the time of Aryabhata much earlier than they do 
in the Chinese works. Accordingly, questions of borrowings on the ground 
of chronological lag, although tempting, cannot be decided for certain. 
From the scanty materials that have survived so far it is safe to say that it 
was by no means a one-way traffic and the mathematical advancement of 
the one stimulated that of the other. 

The part played by India in Arabic literary renaissance is well known. 
When the Arabs, after their successful military conquests of the Middle 
East and North Africa, set themselves upon the intellectual conquest, they 
first turned their attention to the Persian literature of the Sassanian Empire.

Their interest in astronomy was roused by a Persian work on astronomy, 
Zij^ashshahriyar, which was largely a book of tables based on astronomical 
observations carried out in the Sassanian period. This Zij itself was based 
on Indian elements, and it was felt necessary to study Indian astronomy 
in detail for a better understanding of the work. An opportunity presented 
itself when, during the reign of the second Abbasid Caliph al-Mansur 
(753-774), a direct contact with India was established through the Arab 
territory of Sind. Al-Adami reports that an Indian astronomer visited the 
court of al-Mansur and discoursed on Hindu astronomy. Abu-Mashar, 
an astrologer from Balkh, acknowledged his debt to India in obtaining his 
knowledge of the Hindu great cycles. Obviously, these early contacts 
were very useful, for shortly thereafter a number of Arab astronomers 
were commissioned to translate into Arabic Brahmagupta’s Brdhmasphufa- 
siddhdnta and Khandakhddyaka. Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Fazari (d. 796 
or 806) and Ya’qub ibn Tariq (d. 796) produced these translations with the 
assistance of Hindu pandits. Sarton suggests that these translations were 
possibly the vehicle by which Hindu numerals were transmitted to the 
Arabs.® Most probably, the knowledge of Hindu numerals and number- 
writing had spread to Western Asia much earlier, as in the seventh century 
Severus Sebokht, a Christian monk, already mentioned in appreciative 
terms the Hindu numerals. 

The next important figure in the transmission of Hindu astronomy and 
mathematics among the Arabs was al-Khwarizmi, one of the greatest 
mathematicians of his time. Al-KhwarizmI developed a great fiking for 
Indian mathematics and astronomical system, learnt Sanskrit, prepared an 
abridged version of Sindhind (Arabic title of Brdhmasphuta-siddhdnta) and 
wrote an arithmetic explaining the Hindu system of numeration. His 
algebra was also inspired by his Indian studies. Indian studies were so 
fashionable at his time that a number of his notable contemporaries also 
participated actively in this work of transmission. Thus al-Kindl wrote 
four books on the use of the Hindu numerals and computation Hi^dbu'l 
hindi; Habash al-Hasib, al-Nairizi, al-Hasan ibn Mi§bah and ibn al-AdamI 
constructed astronomical tables on Hindu astronomical model. In the 
eleventh century al-Biruni revived Indian studies with fresh energy and 
thoroughness, himself checking corrupt translations of the previous genera- 
tions, producing new translations and critical studies of various aspects of 
Hindu mathematics and astronomy. On Hindu numerals, his was the best 
medieval accoimt. 

There is no doubt that Indian mathematical elements, particularly 
arithmetic based on decimal place-value numeration, passed into Latin 
Europe in the course of transmission of Arabic mathematical knowledge 
there. The leaders of this transmission were, among others, Adelard of 
Bath (c. 1142), John of Seville, Robert of Chester, Villedieu, Sacrobosco 
and Leonardo Pisano.** At this time and up to a much later date, the

abacus of Gerbert was in general use for all calculations and counting 
purposes. Adelard (c. 1142), English philosopher, mathematician and 
scientist, was probably the earliest Latin exponent of Hindu arithmetic, 
trigonometry and astronomy through his translations of al-Khwarizmfs 
mathematical and astronomical works. He probably translated an arith- 
metical work attributed to al-Khwarizmi under the title Liber ysagogarum 
Alchorismi. But the earliest Latin version of al-KhwarizmI’s arithmetic 
Algoritmi de numero Indorum, of which the Arabic version is lost, is due to 
an unknown translator. Hispano-Jewish John of Seville (c. 1135) wrote 
Liber algorismU an arithmetical work which, although based on al-Khwarizmi, 
drew upon other Arabic sources. Robert of Chester (c. 1141) introduced 
the study of algebra in Latin Europe by his translation of al-Khwarizmfs 
Hi^ab al-jabr waLmugdbala which bears the impress of Hindu algebraic 
thought. Villedieu’s (Alexandre de Villedieu, d. 1240) Carmen de algorismo, 
composed in hexameter, closely followed John’s Liber algorismi. Trans- 
lations of Carmen into English, French and Icelandic, several commentaries 
on it and a large number of manuscript copies found in the libraries of 
Europe bear testimony to the influence it exerted and the wide circulation 
it enjoyed in the thirteenth century. The work possibly played an important 
role in the diffusion of Hindu numerals in Latin Europe. Villedieu’s 
contemporary John Sacrobosco’s Algorismus Vulgaris, another arithmetical 
tract, also enjoyed great popularity. Another date often taken to be the 
starting point of European mathematical renaissance is 1202 in which year 
appeared Leonardo Pisano’s arithmetical classic Liber abaci, containing 
probably the first complete exposition in Latin of Hindu and Arabic arith- 
metic, including decimal place-value numeration. 

This is the background of the introduction into Europe of the new 
arithmetic, called ‘algorism’, based on decimal place-value numeration. 
In time algorism became one of the active promoters of the Renaissance 
itself. This is corroborated by the sudden appearance in quantity of printed 
arithmetical works from the sixteenth century in several European countries. 
To mention a few, in Italy, Cardano’s Practica arithmetice et mensurandi 
singularis appeared in 1501 and Tartaglia’s La Prima Parte del general 
trattato di numeri e misure in 1556. In England, Robert Recorde’s The 
grounde of artes, teachyng the worke and practise of arithmetike was re- 
printed seventeen times before 1601 and Digg’s Stratiotios appeared in 1579. 
In Germany, the arithmetical movement was led by Jacob KObel, author of 
Rechenbiechlin (1514), Stifel, author of Arithmetica integra (1514), and 
Christopher Clavius, author of Epitome arithmeticae practice (1583). In 
France, Boissiere’s Uart d'arythmdtique (1554) and Forcadel’s U Arithmitique 
(1556-57) helped popularize arithmetic. Elementary as these arithmetical 
tracts may now appear, their potentialities were soon felt in the rising trade 
and commerce of the Renaissance period, in the teaching programmes of 
universities and schools and in the higher pursuits of mathematics in general. 




MEDICINE 

R. C. Majumdar 


Ayurveda : origin and antiquity 

Medicine is a natural art bom out of the instinct of self-preservation. 
As in every other land, medical knowledge in India must have grown out 
of the sheer necessity of overcoming injury, sickness and pain. This 
overpowering compulsion also made man give up the indiscriminate use 
of raw vegetation and meat from all sources in favour of selective cultivation, 
husbandry, processing, mixing and cooking. The prehistoric art of selecting 
substances which could be assimilated by the human system with benefit 
and their cooking and compounding to give the most of nourishment and 
health forms integral parts of the indigenous medical science of India, known 
as the Ayurveda, The term dyus means duration or span of life; \eda means 
unimpeachable knowledge. Hence the Ayurveda is concerned mainly with 
prolongation of healthy life and prevention of disease and senility and 
only secondarily with curing of disease. The common translation of the 
Ayurveda is ‘science of life’. Surgery is another survival skill which is as 
old as hunting and warfare. 

The growth of the healing art is a part of the natural process of man’s 
adjustment to his environment, and the origin of the Ayurveda cannot be 
credited to any particular age, place or person, despite many legends to 
the contrary. Such legends describing a divine origin and corresponding 
antiquity of the Ayurveda are found in the introductory passages of many 
Ayurvedic texts, e.g. the Caraka, the Suiruta and other Samhitds. It is 
recorded that Brahma (the creator) was the divine source of this science, 
which was brought into existence before the creation of mankind. The 
knowledge passed from him to the god Dak§apati, then to the two celestial 
physicians (the twin A^vinakumaras), later to Indra, the god-king, and 
finally to Bharadvaja, the semi-divine sage. Bharadvaja taught this science 
to a conference of sages meeting somewhere in the Himalayas with the 
common objects of alleviating human suffering and assuring a long, 
healthy and satisfactory life to all human beings. The same or similar 
legends are found in many works, sometimes in greater details. But these 
legends hardly possess any historical value. 



214 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


As far as recorded knowledge goes, the earUest instances of rational 
medical knowledge are to be found in the ^eda and the Atharvaveda, 
both of the second millennium B.c. But there is much evidence to show 
that the Ayurveda was preceded by an earlier medical knowledge developed 
by the builders of the Indus civilization. The Aryans developed it by 
taking up the beliefs and practices of the ‘black-skinned indigenous people’, 
speculating and experimenting freely in their own way, learning much and 
unlearning only that which was patently wrong. 


REMNANTS OF PREVIOUS TRADITIONS 

The medical knowledge of the pre-A^an Indians has been so thoroughly 
mixed, diluted and absorbed into the X^rvedic system that it would be 
an almost hopeless task to attempt to separate the earlier knowledge which 
survives only in some tantras and in the non-Ayurvedic medicine still 
practised by otherwise ignorant medicine men throughout India, employing 
inorganic remedies, secret herbs, animal products and venoms. In the 
beliefs and practices of the primitive aboriginal tribes of India also, a 
storehouse of this ancient knowledge can be discerned. The reputation 
of medical skill possessed by nomadic gypsy tribes, which spread from 
India into Europe and the Mediterranean lands in early times, can also 
be attributed to this primitive knowledge. Some examples of ancient 
Dravida medical lore are believed to have survived intact without debase- 
ment in the non-Ayurvedic systems of medicine still surviving in parts of 
south India, and are found codified in existing treatises in Tamil and other 
south Indian languages. The fragmentary remnants of Agadatantra 
(use of poisons and venoms in curing diseases, and treatment of bites of 
poisonous animals and poisonings) found in various ancient works and 
of Bhutavidya (black magic and treatment of mental diseases and posses- 
sions) found in Vedic lore and in Ayurvedic treatises, as will be discussed 
later, testify to the existence of lost branches of non-Ayurvedic medical 
knowledge incorporated in the Ayurveda, In the Ramayana, Ravana, 
the demon (non-Aryan) king, is said to be a master of many sciences includ- 
ing medical science; and the prince Lak^ma^a is resuscitated from a 
mortal injury by the medical skill of the apes, that is dark-skinned aborigines 
(6th canto; Lak§mana, already dead by the saktUela, is revived by a rare 
plant prescribed by a learned doctor from among the apes). 

ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE 

We know a great deal of pre-Aryan civilization, going back to the 
third millennium b.c., from the archaeological excavations at Mohenjo-daro, 
Harappa and many other sites in the Indus valley and in many other regions 
outside it. The discovery, in these sites, of manufactured implements and 
other objects of metals and alloys, glazed and decorated pottery and figurines,

bricks made in kilns and engravings in precious stones, indicates a high 
level of knowledge of the physical and chemical sciences, likely to^ be 
matched by a similar knowledge of medicinal drugs and compounding. 
This is no doubt a mere conjecture, but the existence of a high level of 
social sanitation and of public hygiene in these communities is fully borne 
out by archaeological findings. Of the broad facts of town-planning, 
use of kiln-bricks, paved streets, municipal water-supply and drainage 
systems, public baths and hydropathic establishments and sanitary instal- 
lations in private houses, there is abundant evidence. Water-proofed 
walls of baths lined with impervious bitumen, arrangements for draining 
and refilling public bathing tanks through conduits, enclosed bathrooms 
and water-closets made of brickwork connected with central water-supply 
and drainage, rubbish chutes emptying into external masonry receptacles 
(presumably cleared on a municipal basis), an efficient and elaborate drainage 
system running beneath the paved streets, spaced brickwork manholes 
of drains with removable lids, and soak-pits suggestive of sanitary privies 
of modern invention, all show a remarkably high level of public health 
activity and universal consciousness of sanitation without parallel in con- 
temporary civilizations and, in fact, most other civilizations of historic 
times. 

It is invariably true that social medicine develops in any country only 
after a fairly high level of medical knowledge has already developed, which 
must have been the case mih this ancient civilization of India. It is also 
true that the extensively studied archaeological remains of contemporary 
and comparable river-valley cultures in Egypt, the Middle East, China and 
Central America show no public sanitation comparable to the findings 
described above. Though this constitutes no real unassailable proof, 
the natural inference is that the medical knowledge of this early phase of 
Indian civilization was superior to, or at least comparable with, what 
obtained elsewhere in the contemporary world. The preserved specimens 
and written records in the form of hieroglyphics (which have been deciphered) 
of ancient Egypt show a knowledge of medicine which can compare with 
later Greek, Roman, Arabic and medieval European civilizations. Unfortu- 
nately, the large mass of pictographic characters on the seals and potteries 
of the Indus civilizations still awaits deciphering and we must wait for 
future success in this work — or another lucky Rosetta stone — to give us 
more data on the state of medical knowledge of the Indus valley and allied 
cultures. 

As mentioned earlier, the beginnings of the Ayurveda may be traced 
first in the J^gveda and then in the Atharvaveda ; its nature and progress will 
be discussed in the next sections of this chapter. Both in its development, 
as also in the production of the famous medical compendiums of the later 
period, the methods and practices of the earlier period typified by the Indus 
civilization, it is reasonable to believe, exerted no mean influence.

A C50NCISB HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


INDIAN MEDICINE IN THE VEDIC PERIOD 

THE CONCEPTION OF MEDICAL SCIENCE 

The oldest ideas of the Aryans on cosmic forces, origin of life, birth, 
death, sickness, pain, happiness and salvation are revealed in the Vedic 
hymns where rational ideas and insight are found to be continuously crystal- 
lizing out of a matrix of ignorance and superstition, even in the earliest 
Sarphitas. Interwoven with archaic concepts of diseases, both of the mind 
and the body, as manifestations of the wrath of gods for sins committed 
or as possessions by demons,^ to be cured by propitiation, ritual practices, 
sacrifices or exorcism, sorcery or charms,^ we find logical speculations on the 
origins of diseases, use of healing drugs, beneficial treatment and surgery. 
There is also the clear emergence of the conception of the healing art as not 
a mere skill but as a social system tolerating many other ingredients such 
as the powers of magic and suggestions, ideas gained by experience and 
experiments, the social value of health, compassion to human suffering, 
scientific tenets and philosophical speculations. It is from these nebulous 
beginnings that the Ayurvedic conception of medical knowledge as a 
comprehensive science and philosophy of life developed later. 

During this period, the healing art was recognized as a part of the 
sacramental duties of the priests. The priest-sorcerers were the physi- 
cians, par excellence, though wandering medicine men, mentioned in the 
Atharvaveda, also practised medicine and surgery. The tradition of medi- 
cine as a part of the religious lore continued unbroken up to the later 
period of the Ayurvedic treatises, in which medical science is declared to 
be a updnga (part) of the Atharvaveda,^ the physician a special votary of the 
same Veda^ and also Ayurveda as an upaveda (secondary veda), forming 
part of the ^gveda. 

The Aryans personified the natural and cosmic forces as gods, and 
their influence was considered supreme in causing and curing illness. Water 
was the primordial element of the Aryans. ‘In the waters is the nectar 
of immortality, and in the water is the potent curative powers.*^' Divinity 
was also conferred upon plants with healing powers. The hymn, osadhistuti 
(ode to the healing plants), is addressed to soma, the moon god and the 
divine ruler of plants, and also a terrestrial plant from which sacrificial 
liquor was prepared,^ 

An almost parallel conception of medicine is found in the sacred books 
of another branch of the Indo- Aryan community, the Avesta of the Iranians. 
The medical data of the Avesta are mostly found in the Videvdat dating 
from Vedic times. This book of the Avesta, also known as Vendidad, 
escaped destruction by Alexander the Great and was preserved in a Greek 
translation. The Spirit of Evil {Ahira Mainya) and other demons bring

all diseases which can be cured by exorcism, mantras (holy chantings), 
sacrifices of cattle, and also by baesajas (drugs).® Innumerable plants with 
healing powers are associated with the ‘waters’ (which is not only the 
primordial element but also a source of health) and with haoma, the liquor 
of immortality. The cosmic elements rule over the human body and cause 
its functions and malfunctions, the human body being the microcosm of the 
universe.^ Three types of medicine men are distinguished; those who 
practise with the knife, with plants, and with holy words, the last class being 
the most esteemed. 


ADMIXTURE OF RATIONAL IDEAS WITH PRIMITIVE SUPERSTITIONS 

Anatomical and physiological terms, biological ideas, methods of 
treatment, and rudimentary theories on the origins of life and of diseases 
are scattered in the different works of Vedic literature in a remarkable 
admixture of accurate knowledge and rational ideas with superstitious 
beliefs and faith in the supernatural. This makes Vedic literature a rich 
storehouse both of medical knowledge and of the pseudo-medical ideas 
of the times. This was a twilight period for Indian medicine when scientific 
theories and progressive methods were struggling to emerge from a morass 
of primitive ideas and irrational rituals. 

Though diseases and even accidents are attributed to supernatural 
causes, many passages indicate that illness may be due to other and natural 
reasons. A passage states that a disease can have one of the three possible 
origins, i.e. abhraja (from clouds or moisture), vatqja (from wind) and 
susmaja (from desiccating agents).® The term pitta, for the desiccating or 
the fiery principle, occurs in another passage of the Atharvaveda.^ ^le^md, 
for the aqueous principle, occurs in the Satapatha Brdhmana. The term 
tridhatu, possibly referring to the three bodily humours, occurs in the earliest 
work, Rgxeda, In view of the extreme importance of this reference, it may 
be mentioned that many European scholars, including Langlois, the translator 
of the Rgveda, Reinbold Muller and J. Filliozat, do not accept that the 
phrase tridhatu idrma vahatam refers to the bodily humours. But the 
ancient commentator Sayanacarya has rendered tridhatu §drma as ‘well-being 
of the three bodily elements’ in the classical Ayurvedic sense, and this 
interpretation has been accepted by Wilson, Cordier, and Pauthier and 
Braunet. If the latter view is correct, this Vedic conception of the humoral 
theory antedates Greek ideas on the subject by at least one thousand years. 

Diseases are also said to be caused by ksetriya (congenital) factors 
or by infection,® by change of seasons, specially in the case of takman fevers 
which recur periodically,^ and by krmis (minute insects living inside the body).®

A CONCISE mSTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


Cures arc effected by charms, imprecations against demons and sorcerers, 
sacrifices and propitiation of divine favour by the chanting of h)anns and 
ritual practices. But a large number of plant remedies are recommended for 
curing diseases in many passages, mainly in the Vajasaneyi, Taittirlya and 
Maitrdyam Samhitds. The metals gold and lead and some animal products are 
also used as healing agents. Sunlight, milk and milk products, honey, etc., 
are recommended in some passages for their therapeutic and nutritive values. 
Surgery and surgical methods are described for a number of conditions. 

These contradictions of the primitive and the progressive, sometimes 
in the same hymns, no doubt indicate a transitional stage of medical 
knowledge, but some of the apparently irrational methods are possibly 
not as worthless as they appear at first sight. Vedic treatment often follows 
a set formula of propitiation of the angered gods, appeasement of malignant 
forces, magic formulas with the auxiliary use of material remedies like 
amulets, external applications and internal medicines. Along with this 
complex and concerted attack at many levels is a psychiatric approach 
in the shape of frequent appeals (by suggestions and mesmeric repetitions) 
to the patient who is constantly assured of progressive healing and ultimate 
cure. This psychosomatic view of physical as well as mental diseases and 
the deliberate employment of the combined mental resources of the healer 
and the patient were retained, though in a much modified form, in the 
later and more scientific system of Ayurvedic medicine. 

Despite its deceptive primitive garb, its obsession with magic and 
religion and its heavy leaning on irrational methods, Vedic medicine contains 
so much of rational observations and inferences and so much accurate 
medical knowledge that it almost merits the name of a science. Different 
ailments affecting the head, eyes, ears, heart, lungs and stomach, skin 
diseases, urinary complaints, progressive emaciation (consumption), external 
and internal abscesses, jaundice, rheumatism and neuralgia are listed in 
the early Vedic texts. Some of the diseases named are: ailava (eye diseases), 
alaji (inflammation of the eyes), ak^ata (rupture or ulceration of the lungs), 
apaci (scrofula), ar^a (piles), dsrdva (formation of pus), baldsa (chronic 
asthma or bronchitis), harimd (jaundice), hrdroga (heart diseases), hrdyota 
(malfunctioning of the heart), jayanya (a type of consumption), karnaiula 
(earache), kdHka (chronic cough), kildsa (leprosy), kusfha (persistent skin 
diseases), rdjayaksmd (severe and progressive wasting disease), sikatd 
(calculi), sirsakti (headache), iir^dmaya (diseases of the head), takman 
(fevers), udara (dropsy), visarpa (extensive skin eruptions), visalyaka 
(neuralgia), viskandha (rheumatism), yaksmd (consumptive conditions), etc. 
Due to semantic reasons the English equivalents are subject to mistakes, 
and are at best approximate. In some cases their symptoms are described. 

The samhitds also name nearly 300 limbs and inner organs of the body 
of which a complete list is given by Filliozat.® The birth of a baby is 
described in the Atharvaveda and the physician is recommended, in case 


Filliozat (2), pp. 144 ff.

of complications in delivery, to operate upon the mehana (birth channel), 
yoni (womb) and gavinaka (connecting canal).® Other surgical processes 
described or mentioned are incisions for boils, surgical relief of angry 
swellings caused by imbedded arrows, etc.,*^ treatment of fractures, use of 
a reed as catheter to relieve painful or blocked urination,^ surgical removal 
of an injured eyeball* and the replacement of a leg amputated in battle by 
an iron limb.-^ The last reference may be metaphorical rather than actual. 

The idea of rejuvenation (of the ageing body and its faculties) is first 
found in the Rgveda. Ayusydni (measures and treatment aimed at main- 
taining perfect health of mind and body and also promoting longevity) is 
one of the twin aims of medical science according to the Atharvaveda, 
the other being bhaisajydni (curative treatment by medication). Hygiene 
and dietetics are considered integral parts of medical knowledge and many 
passages are devoted to the preventive aspect of medical science. Milk is 
said to confer strength, nutrition, intelligence, brightness of complexion and 
also to help proper growth of the foetus, and hence recommended for the 
pregnant woman.^ The benefits of surd (alcoholic beverages) and of madhu 
(honey) are also described in many hymns. Rice of good quality taken as a 
cereal is said to improve vital capacity and help infants to grow their 
milk teeth.* 

There is no attempt to classify the anatomical and physiological 
information nor are the diseases classified according to any scheme. There 
is, however, a rudimentary attempt at symptomatic treatment, the drug 
administered being chosen with an eye to its supposed ability of making 
good the visible deficiency. 


MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE IN LATER VEDIC TEXTS 

The medical references in the earlier samhitds are casual and frag- 
mentary, but the later Vedic works are distinguished by a search for order 
and by speculations about origins and underlying causes. A number of 
passages contain plausible theories about the composition of living and 
non-living matter, the biological functions, the relationship of the iarJra 
(human body and organism) to its environment, the nature of the vital 
and motive forces in a living body, and other matters. The theory that the 
same five elements, pcthivl (earth or solid), apas (water or liquid), vdyu 
(air or gas), j’yoti (fire or radiant energy) and dkdh (ether or empty space), 
constitute the human body (microcosm) as well as the macrocosm is accepted 
as axiomatic truth in many passages.* Life in its various manifestations is 
said to have three possible types of origin, andaja (oviparous), jardyuja

(viviparous) and svedaja (bom by combined effect of warmth and moisture).® 
The vayu (wind) in the human organism is classified into five types according 
to physiological locations and functions, and the idea of identifying vdyu 
with the nervous system (with motor and sensory functions and control of 
the seat of consciousness as well as the involuntary muscles) is clearly 
discernible/ Physiological data, presumably obtained by dissection, are 
found in many passages. The human body is supposed to contain, dispersed 
in all its parts, 100 dhamanls (major blood-carrying tubes), 1,000 hirds (minor 
veins, etc.),® 72,000 hitas (extremely minute capillaries)** and 10,800 pesos 
(muscle-fibres).® The therapeutic values of milk and milk products are 
described in the later Vedic texts also; milk compounded with turmeric is 
recommended for jaundice freshly churned butter is said to be of great 
dietic value to children and pregnant women, but clarified butter is recom- 
mended for healthy adults clarified butter mixed with various drugs is 
given for preventing miscarriage.* 

Some surprisingly advanced theories and valid observations are found 
in a work styled Garbha Upanisad, the antiquity of which has been doubted 
by many scholars. The suspect passages may also have been interpolated 
at a later date. It contains, among other things, a detailed description of 
the periodic changes which occur in the foetus during the period of gestation, 
a theory of metabolic changes occurring in the body and a list of the six 
different tastes, seven body elements (blood, flesh, fat, connective tissues, 
bones, marrow and semen) and three waste products (stool, urine and sweat). 
Even if this last evidence is ignored, Vedic literature furnishes us with an 
array of medical facts and theories which are impressive, considering their 
antiquity. This knowledge must have served as a valuable source material 
for the later science of Ayurveda. In fact, many of the physiological ideas 
are retained with modifications and elaborations in the latter. 

MEDICINE IN BUDDHIST LITERATURE 

The fundamental conceptions and observations on different subjects, scat- 
tered pell-mell in Vedic literature, were collected together under appropriate 
titles from the sixth century b.c. onwards in separate texts known as sutras. 

Erudite and comprehensive treatises were also written on most of 
the subjects, and a part of this vast literature survives up to the present 
time. Followers of all religious faiths-— Brahmai?as, Buddhists, Jains 
and others — contributed to this specialized literature. In medicine, the 
contributions of Buddhist scholars are of great significance and outstanding 
value. NagSijuna the medical author, the later Nagarjuna (who composed

many treatises on rasacikitsd, metallurgy and alchemy), Vfigbhafa, many 
of the Siddha authors of the iatrochemical school, and nearly all the medical 
missionaries who carried Indian medical science into Tibet, Central Asia, 
China and Ceylon were followers of the Buddhist faith. The contributions 
of the Buddhist scholars contain no new features differing basically from 
other works. In medicine, as in other branches of knowledge, there 
was no division on the basis of religion, for the Buddhists of these centuries 
were not an isolated community but characteristically and completely 
Indian in outlook. 

Some of the Buddhist canonical literature contain medical information 
interwoven with religious matter. The Bhaisajyavastu, forming part of 
volume 3 of the Gilgit Manuscripts^ gives instructions regarding the use 
and dosage of medicinal drugs, classification of plant drugs, the useful 
parts of various plants, etc. But these follow Ayurvedic tenets and are 
of no special value. The Clvaravastu (Part 2, volume 3 of the Gilgit 
Manuscripts) contains a long passage on the medical training of Prince 
Jivaka (physician of King Bimbisara, a contemporary of Gautama Buddha) 
and some marvellous cures effected by him. If the information in this 
work is accepted at its face value, difficult surgical operations called 
kapdla mocana involving removal of a portion of the skull and reaching 
the brain inside, eye surgery, curetting of the cervical region, removal of 
vaginal tumours, as also medical treatment of dropsy, internal tumours, 
varicose veins, eye diseases, etc., must have developed at this early age. 
The medical stories found in the Clvaravastu and other Buddhist canonical 
works may not be true in all details, but they certainly give us an 
idea of the degree of knowledge— actual and probable, real or hypo- 
thetically possible — current at the time when these texts were composed, 
i.e. two or three centuries before the Christian era. 

Very interesting information is given about JTvaka besides the above 
details of medical cure. He studied medicine at Taxila under a world- 
renowned physician for the prescribed period of seven years. But, before 
he was given the licence to practise medicine, he had to undergo a sort of 
practical examination prescribed by his teacher, who directed: ‘Take this 
spade and seek round about Taksa^ila a yojana on every side, and whatever 
plant you see which is not medicinal, bring it to me.’ After a good deal 
of botanical investigations, Jivaka could not discover any plant that was 
devoid of medicinal properties. The teacher was satisfied and gave him 
a little money with leave to go home and practise as a physician.® This 
story implies a current belief that all plants as well as reeds, water, 
stone and metals possess medical value, i.e. potentiality of healing. The 
same idea is found in the Caraka Sarnhitd which states that ‘each and every 
substance, due to its inherent and specific properties, can be utilized in 
some disease or other’.*' Jivaka also learnt the great value of meticulous 
observation and of valid deductions based on such observations. By

observing the area over which an elephant had passed earlier, he was able to 
give many details about the animal and its rider and to correlate his 
deductions with details considered unimportant by others. This anecdote 
points out the value of accurate observation and deductions in the medical 
profession. Jivaka also learnt that erudition and skill in the science of 
medicine should not merely lead to a lucrative practice but should be taught 
to others in order to benefit humanity. 


Ayurveda : the special treatises 

AYURVEDIC SAMHITAS 

Ayurveda had its origin in the healing art of the Vedic period. Its 
development as a comprehensive and rational medical system came in the 
succeeding centuries side by side with the flowering of the philosophies, 
arts and sciences in the golden age of Hindu civilization. Our knowledge 
of this ancient science comes mainly from the surviving written treatises, 
the oldest of which are the samhitds named after Bhela (or Bheda), Caraka 
and Su^ruta. The first has reached us in a single and very incomplete 
manuscript but many independent references in other ancient works as 
well as the internal evidence put its authenticity and antiquity beyond 
reasonable doubt. It is very possibly the oldest medical treatise in existence. 
Nagnajit, an authority on toxicology, mentioned in the Aitareya and Sata- 
patha Brdhmams, is also mentioned in this work as a contemporary living 
person.® This makes the original BheJa Samhitd a work of the period 
of the Brahmanas, The work, as recent studies indicate, contains some 
valuable materials to fill up gaps in both the Caraka and Susruta Samhitds \ 
but on account of its fragmentary and mutilated character, it does not 
provide a full exposition of Ayurvedic medical knowledge. 

The other two works now available as later redactions, respectively 
by Dfdhabala (eighth or ninth century a.d.) and Nagarjuna (c. third century 
A.D.), of earlier works belong entirely to a different category. Both are 
erudite and exhaustive compendiums, incorporating and codifying the 
theoretical and practical knowledge of medicine and its contributory arts 
and sciences available at the times. The Caraka and Susruta Sarnhitds were 
followed in later centuries by more sophisticated treatises, commentaries 
and medical encyclopaedias (which were largely based on materials obtained 
from the two earlier works), but they have retained their place during two 
millennia as the two most complete and representative works on Ayurveda, 
Most of our present knowledge of the extent and depth of Indian medical 
science is obtained from these two standard works. 

By their own testimonies, the extant texts of the two great sarrihitds are 
revisions of the original with additions and alterations. There is evidence 

• Sharma, (S. V.), pp. 228-30; see Journal of Dept, of Letters, Calcutta, 6, p. 30.

of many medical treatises which were composed before these two but are 
now quite untraceable, and each of these two names a particular earlier 
treatise on which it is based. Caraka’s original was the satphitd of 
Agnive^a,® a disciple of the medical sage Atreya. Long passages in the 
Caraka Samhitd are in the form of questions and answers between Atreya 
and Agnive^a. This original Agnivesa Samhitd was referred to even so late 
as the eleventh century a.d. by Cakrapani Datta in his Ayurvedadipikd. In 
a similar way the Susruta Samhitd contains a series of discourses between 
the holy sage Dhanvantari and his disciple Susruta, ** but much of the original 
material seems to have been revised by the redactor, Nagaijuna, who has also 
made considerable additions to the text, according to the commentator 
Palhaijacarya. 


CHRONOLOGY OF THE SAIfHITAS 

There is no reason why the given sequences of authorship and editor- 
ships should not be accepted as correct, but acute difficulty is encountered 
in providing the above-named persons with actual historical dates. There 
is a sage Atreya in the Rgveda; another one of the same name was a famous 
medical teacher at Taxila at the time of Gautama Buddha; and two more ace 
found in the Caraka Samhitd^ itself ; an Agnivesa is found in the Mahdbhdrata 
who is unlikely to be the disciple of Atreya. Caraka is a class title of a 
school of physicians, existing from Vedic times, and also the personal 
title of a physician in the court of King Kaniska,^ and very possibly the 
title of many other physicians belonging to the same school of medicine. 
According to many commentaries by reputed Indian authors of the first 
millennium a.d. and later, Patanjali, the great philosopher and alchemist 
of early Buddhist times, was identical with Caraka of the Samhitd J 
Again Dhanvantari is a legendary, divine personage in many Vedic texts of 
widely different ages; Susruta is said to be the son of the Vedic sage, 
Vi^vamitra, but another Susruta is referred to by Katyayana (a contem- 
porary of Candragupta Maurya), the author of a vdrtika to Panini’s 
Vydkarana; Nagarjuna is the name or title of at least two, possibly three, 
philosophers, alchemists and scholars between the third century b.c. and 
al-Bir uni’s time, tenth century a.d. The difficult task of identifying the 
medical authors has to be undertaken only on the basis of available evidence 
and chance references in other sources of established chronology. The 
most commonly accepted dates for the composition of the Caraka Samhitd 
(which formed the basis of Drdhabala’s version) and N5garjuna’s redaction 
of the older Suiruta Samhitd are a.d. 100, and third to fourth century a.d. 
respectively. These conclusions were arrived at by the Chronology Com- 
mittee of the National Institute of Sciences of India after considering the

entire available data on the subject. The original Agniveh and Suiruta 
Satfihitds must have preceded these works by many centuries, as they had to 
be extensively revised and restored. 


THE CONTENTS OF THE AYURVEDIC SAMHITAS 

The Caraka and Suiruta Samhitas mention the eight different branches 
of medical knowledge,® but the treatises are not written accordingly. 
The former is an exhaustive work on the first branch (therapeutic medicine) 
only, though it contains many sections dealing with surgery and the 
other six branches. It deals mainly with anatomy, physiology, aetiology 
and prognosis, pathology, treatment, objectives, influence of environmental 
factors, medicines and appliances, and procedure and sequence of medi- 
cation. For discussion of these topics the work is divided into eight sthdnas 
(sections) containing 150 chapters in all. The Su^ruta Samhitd follows 
more or less the same pattern, but it gives surgery the place of honour. 
In fact, the Dhanvantari school of medicine, to which it belongs, believes 
surgery to be the most ancient and most efficacious of the eight branches 
of medical knowledge.^ The Stdruta Samhitd contains six sthdnas deal- 
ing with fundamental postulates, pathology, embryology and anatomy, 
therapeutic and surgical treatment, toxicology, and a final section on 
subsequently gained and specialized knowledge of topics dealt with in 
earlier sections, and contains a total of 184 chapters. In both the works 
the topics are not distributed in the text in the way that would appear 
logical to modern minds, and often the same topic recurs in different isolated 
chapters. Still, the over-all picture is of codified, scientific treatises, the 
Susruta being more concise in language and a repository of more factual 
information; it describes the necessity and modus operandi of dissections 
on human cadavers for gaining accurate anatomical knowledge. 

The special physiological and pathological ideas of Ayurveda as also 
its special methods of a diagnosis and treatment will be discussed later. 
Some of its achievements merit special mention. The materia medica is 
extensive and represents a full utilization of environmental resources. More 
than 600 drugs of animal, plant and mineral origin are used in the Caraka 
and about 650 in the Susruta Satphitd, The large variety of medicinal 
prescriptions, methods of compounding, therapeutic methods including 
psychiatric processes and surgical processes employing specific instruments 
for each type of operation are scientific, sound and exhaustive. Susruta 
describes more than 300 different operations employing 42 different surgical 
processes and 121 different types of instruments. Some irrational methods 
are, however, prescribed for some mental aberrations and diseases of 
new-born infants. 

Symptoms are described for a large number of pathological conditions 
and diseases, including diabetes mellitus, pulmonary tuberculosis, malignant

growths, leprosy, gangrene, erysipelas, jaundice, diphtheria, tetanus, calculi, 
general paralysis, insanity, epilepsy, epidemic diseases, bites of poisonous 
snakes and animals, and hydrophobia. Rational and apparently efficacious 
surgery is described for many conditions including complicated fractures 
and dislocations, piles, fistulas and sinuses,® tumours, carbuncles and malig- 
nant growths, cataracts and complicated opthalmic operations,*’ strangulated 
hernia,^ urinary stones causing uraemia, impacted gall-stone, intestinal 
perforations and protrusions of the viscera due to accidental injuries,^ 
amputation of major limbs, tonsilitis, bone abscesses and abscesses of internal 
organs, serious head injuries with exudation of brain matter, major obstetric 
operations including removal of the foetus^ by craniotomic and other 
methods,*' and congenital malformations of the nose, ears or lips.-^ The 
last-named operation required plastic surgery involving grafting of skin 
and muscular tissues from surrounding areas and other parts of the body 
and was also used to help people whose noses or ears had been removed 
for penal reasons, apparently a common practice of the period. 

Apart from the above achievements, Ayurveda is remarkable for its 
special conceptions and theories. It must be emphasized that the curing 
of diseased conditions and the maintenance of health are not the only 
aims of Ayurveda. It is also concerned with harmonizing secular conduct 
and spiritual pursuit through a realization of the true relationship between 
the complex of body, mind and soul and the eternal universe. As such, 
it is more a comprehensive philosophy of life, with salvation as its goal, 
than a science in the modern sense of the term. Theories of creation of

for the training of physicians, and a meticulous code of personal ethics and 
social conduct for the medical profession.^ In insight, farsightedness and 
depth, the Ayurvedic medical code stands a favourable comparison with 
the Hippocratic code. The entire texts of the samhitas are also distin- 
guished by careful and penetrating observations, exhaustive and classified 
information, and an able presentation of the available knowledge in 
medicine and allied subjects like chemistry, botany, etc., contributing to 
medicine.

226 A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 

LOST TREATISES OF AYURVEDA 

Apart from the two great samhitas, there were many other treatises 
on the therapeutic branch of medicine, termed the Atreya school of medicine. 
Some of them are lost beyond all possible hope of recovery, but their names 
and subjects are available from references in existing works. Such lost 
treatises include the samhitas credited to Agnive^a, K§arapani, Jatukarna, 
Para^ara, Harlta, Ksaranada, Visvamitra, Kapila and Gautama. Of the 
Dhanvantari school with its stress on surgery, the lost works are the Vrddha 
Susruta or Sausruta tantra, the treatises credited to Aupadhenava, Aurabhra, 
Pau§kalavata, Gopurarak§ita, Vaitara^a and Bhoja. The Bhoja-samhitd^ 
also known as Vrddhabhoja, should not be confused with a lexicon compiled 
by Bhojaraja of a much later age. 


EXTANT CLASSICAL WORKS ON AYURVEDA 

Among the major existing works of the Atreya school (apart from the 
Caraka) are about 50 known commentaries and editions of the Agnive^a 
of Caraka Samhitd,^ the notable works being those of Dr^habala (ninth 
century), Cakrapaiiidatta (eleventh century) and iSivadasa (eleventh century). 
Among a smaller number of editions and commentaries of Susruta 
Samhitd, the most notable are those of Nagarjuna (third to fourth 
century), palhanacarya (tenth-eleventh century) and Cakradatta (eleventh 
century). 

Next in importance as well as in age (with the possible exception of 
Kdsyapa Safphitd) come two works with somewhat similar names, the 
Astdnga Sarpgraha also known as Vrddha Vdgbhafa and the Asfangahrdaya, 
known simply as Vdgbhala, Both are comprehensive works on thera- 
peutics and surgery, one in prose-cwm-verse and the other in verse alone. 
From the distinctive name of the first work as the ‘ancient’ Vagbhata, 
some assumed differences in quality, and from the very fact of the existence 
of two different works, it has been supposed that there were two different 
authors of this name, one earlier and one later. The authors (or author) 
in both cases, however, claim the same parentage and profess the same 
school of Buddhist faith. It is known that Vagbhata was the son of 
Sirphagupta, an inhabitant of Sind and a disciple of Avalokita, the Buddhist 
sage, but no separate particulars are available about the other author. The 
internal evidence also shows an identity of style, medical views and mode 
of presentation, and there is no real evidence to show that there was more 
than one author of this name.*’ 

The first mention of a medical book on Astdnga is found in the memoirs 
of the Chinese traveller ITsing of the seventh century. The author of this 
book has been identified with the Buddhist Vagbhata who may, therefore, 
be placed in the seventh century a.d. or a little earlier.

The A^fangahrdaya is by far the most concise and scientific exposi- 
tion of Ayurvedic knowledge, incorporating the teachings of the Atreya, 
Dhanvantari and Rasayana® schools of medicine and distinguished by its 
knowledge of chemical reactions and laboratory processes. The work has 
been translated into many Indian and foreign languages, and enjoys a 
deserved reputation rivalling those of Caraka and Su^ruta. The important 
commentaries on Vagbhata’s works are by Arupadatta (thirteenth century), 
Candrananda, Hemadri and Indu. 

The Kasyapa Samhita is another ancient treatise dealing mainly 
with paediatrics. It is probably of an age not much later than that of the 
Bhela Sarphita, if we consider that it is admittedly an abridged edition or 
version of an earlier work, the Vrddha Kasyapa.^ It is quoted in the Bower 
manuscript and contains many quotations, not found elsewhere, from the 
most ancient works of the Atreya school including some missing treatises. 

A valuable work, specializing on the diagnostic aspect of medical 
knowledge, is due to Madhavakara (eighth or ninth century) and is entitled 
Rugviniscaya or Madhava Niddna, It is a compilation from the earlier 
works of Agnivesa, Su^ruta and Vagbhata, but its merit lies in its scientific 
selection of knowledge included, concise presentation, and as a valuable 
clinical guide. It is famous all over India as the best Ayurvedic work on 
diagnosis of diseases. Two commentaries on this work, Madhuko^a by 
Vijayaraksita and Atankadarpam by Vacaspati, are also valuable aids to 
diagnosis. The Gadanigraha, a medical treatise by So^hala (seventh century), 
SodhalanighantUy a medical lexicon by the same author, Siddhayoga by 
Vrndakunda (ninth century), and Cakrasatngraha, a valuable treatise 
containing quotations from earlier works by Cakrapanidatta (about 
A.D. 1050), are other important works on the Atreya and Dhanvantari 
schools, containing also some information on inorganic medicines, 
written before a.d. 1 200. Only a few of the Ayurvedic works listed above 
are available in printed editions, others being in the form of written 
manuscripts preserved in various collections in India and abroad. The 
descriptions and locations are to be found in Aufrecht’s Catalogue. KaviraJ 
Gananath Sen has made an assessment of the comparative merits of these 
different works.*^

THE EIGHT ANGAS OF AYURVEDA 

The term asfdnga (eight-limbed) used in the titles of Vagbhata’s works 
is actually a synonym of Ayurveda which, from ancient times, has been 
supposed to contain eight branches of medical knowledge. These branches

are enumerated in the introductory passages of aU important Ayurvedic 
works though most of them specialize in one or at most two branches and 
give only limited space to the rest. The lists given by Caraka, Su^nita 
and Vagbhata are identical though different in order.'* Caraka uses the 
term visagaravairodhikaprahmana for antidotes and cures for poisons and 
venoms in place of agada (toxicology). The eight branches and the topics 
they include are enumerated below: 

(i) Kdyacikitsd (therapeutics) dealing with the aetiology, diagnosis, 

prognosis, treatment and recommended diets in fevers, gastro- 
intestinal irritations, coughs, consumptive maladies, urinary 
complaints and other ailments, curable by the administration 
of drugs, externally or internally; 

(ii) ^alyatantra (surgical knowledge) divided into two branches; 

the first deals with diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of condi- 
tions amenable to surgical methods, specifications and uses 
of different surgical instruments, methods of bleeding, cauteriza- 
tion by heat and alkali, use of leeches, and minor surgical 
implements in appropriate contexts; the second deals with 
surgical knowledge applied to gynaecology and obstetrics; 

(iii) §dlakyatantra (treatment of diseases of the eyes, ears, nose, 

tongue, oral cavity and throat); 

(iv) Bhutavidyd (knowledge of mental diseases and diseases of 

supernatural origin) dealing with the true nature, symptoms 
and treatments of conditions like insanity, epilepsy, etc., in 
which people behave as if affected by demons; 

(v) Kaumdrabhrtya (knowledge of infantile disorders, care of young 

children and treatment of diseases specific to children); 

(vi) Agadatantra (toxicology) dealing with symptoms caused by 

accidental or intentional administration of mineral, vegetable 
and animal poisons, bites by venomous snakes and other 
poisonous creatures, their immediate antidotes and methods 
of treatment; 

(vii) Rasdyana (knowledge of tonics and processes for arresting the 

process of physical and mental decay) dealing with potent drugs 
and prescriptions to combat ill health, natural decay and senility, 
their dosages and methods of administration; 

(viii) Vdjlkaranatantra (knowledge of virilifics) dealing with lost or 
diminished virility, potency and procreative ability. 

THE ATREYA and DHANVANTARI SYSTEMS 

The medical literature specializing in the therapeutic and surgical 
branches of medical knowledge has already been reviewed in the previous 
section. Most of the works mentioned there however claim to be a 


CS,SU.,^\SS.Su., 1 . 



MEDICINE 


229 


comprehensive treatise on Ayurveda (and hence on all its branches) and 
generally devote some passages or even sections to the other six branches. 

Quite a number of treatises specializing in the other angas were also 
in parallel existence with the works of the Atreya and Dhanvantari schools. 
But the zeal displayed by later scholars for reproducing or editing the latter 
works seems to have been lacking for the other branches. Original works 
in the other angas are generally met with only in the form of quotations 
in later works or in names only; commentaries and revised editions are 
conspicuous by their absence. Even the quotations that are found are 
few and far between. A study of the literature of Ayurveda in the post- 
Vedic period leaves a strong impression that the works of the Atreya and 
Dhanvantari schools were always considered the elite among medical 
treatises while the others were considered second-class matter. 


THE ^ALAKYATANTRA SYSTEM 

A class of physicians known as Salakis specialized in this branch of 
medicine, the chief treatise of which was Videhatantra supposed to be the 
work of King Janaka of Videha. This work is mentioned as important 
in the sections on Sdlakyatantra found in the Su§ruta Samhitd,^ and has 
been extensively quoted by Qalhanacarya, Vijayarak§ita §rlkanthadatta and 
others. Other works on this branch of medicine, quoted by the last 
three authors, are Nunitantra and Satyakltantra, Caraka mentions the 
Kdnkayanatantra and the Saunakatantra. Qalhana and grlkantha also 
mention other works in this branch, attributed to Gargya, Galavya, 
Karalabhatta, Krsnatreya, as also another work Caksusyatantra dealing with 
eye diseases alone. None of these works are available now but all must 
have been extant in Dalhana’s time (tenth-eleventh century). The sparse 
quotations available do not permit of a proper assessment of these works. 


bhutavidyA 

No special treatise on this subject has been quoted or even named 
in the surviving works. This branch of Ayurveda survives now only as 
chapters in the works of Caraka,*' 5'u§ruta'' and Vagbhala.** The Caraka 
Samhitd treats all psychic maladies, including grave diseases of the nervous 
system, insanity and demoniac possessions, in a single chapter. The A^fdnga 
and Suiruta Samhitd consider demoniac possessions as separate from mental 
diseases. The Agnipurdna and the Vdyupurdna also deal with demoniac 
possessions and the remedial measures recommended for them. From the 
fact of Caraka’s classification of demoniac possessions in the same chapter

with mental disorders and Su^ruta’s declaration that malignant spirits cause 
diseases but do not physically ‘possess’ human beings (na te manu§yaifi 
saha samvihnti), it seems likely that in these times bhutavidyd simply meant 
psychic disorders caused by unknown forces. The later treatises after 
Vagbhata ignore this branch of medicine altogether, possibly to avoid 
being branded with the stigma of superstition. 


THE KAUMARADIlJ^rVA SYSTEM 

The Kdsyapa Samhitd, as is to be expected, contains considerable 
information on infantile disorders and care of new-born babies and older 
children. The Uttaratantra of Nagarjuna’s version of the Su^ruta Satfihitd 
devotes no less than 12 chapters to this branch of medicine. Invocation 
of divine blessings, chanting of holy words and propitiation of supernatural 
forces formed a major part of such treatment, along with treatment by 
therapeutic drugs. The chapters in the Susruta Samhitd convey the clear 
impression that an extremely high value was put on the health, welfare 
and mental happiness of children at this time. This started even from the 
period of conception, and an equally high value was placed on the physical 
and psychological well-being of expectant mothers. Midwifery and gynaeco- 
logical knowledge was not, however, included in the branch of Kaumdra- 
hhrtya. 

The treatises known to have dealt specially with this subject were the 
JJvaka tantra quoted in Cakradatta’s commentary Bhdnumati on the 
Susruta Satfihitd, Pdrvataka tantra, Vandhaka tantra and Hiranydksa tantra 
(quoted by Srikantha Datta). These works survive only in names, except 
for occasional quotations. 


THE AGADAT ANTRA SYSTEM 

The Caraka Samhitd devotes only one chapter to this branch of medicine 
but the Susruta has one of its six sthdnas, e.g. Kalpasthdna, entirely on 
toxicology. Apart from symptoms, first-aid measures and long-term 
treatments, there is a very good classification of different poisons and on 
different methods by which unwary persons may be slowly or quickly 
poisoned. The detection of some inorganic poisons by flame tests is a 
remarkable feature. There is also an exhaustive classification and de- 
scription of different types of poisonous snakes and the symptoms of their 
bites. Similar information (including a faithful account of the symptoms 
of hydrophobia) is found for poisonous insects, aquatic and amphibious 
creatures and land animals. In fact, the Kalpasthdna of the Susruta 
Samhitd is a valuable treatise on toxicology by its own right. 

A treatise on toxicology, also named Kdfyapa Sarphiid, written in 
Sanskrit but printed in local script, is found in South India. Some passages 
in this work arc identical with certain quotations in the works of Palha^ia,

Cakrapaiji and iSrlkantha.® But the authenticity of the text cannot be 
verified. Srlkaijtha also gives quotations from another work in this field, 
the Avalamvayanasamhitdy which must have survived up to the seventeenth 
century but is now untraceable. Another treatise on agadatantra^ the Sanaka 
Sarfthitd (or Samaka Samhitd), survives in an Arabic translation discovered 
by Max Muller.*" palhana quotes from another treatise on this subject, 
apparently his own work, in his commentary on Nagarjuna’s Su^ruta Samhitd* 
In Cochin and Travancore, many other Sanskrit works on agada- 
tantra are available in the local script. Their authenticity and antiquity 
have not been established beyond doubt. 


the rasayana system 

The conception of rasayana (restorative treatment) is a notable feature 
of Ayurveda. With age there is a degeneration of bodily tissues, sensory 
perceptions, as also of physical and intellectual vigour. Ayurveda considers 
this process not only preventive but even reversible and does not consider 
senility an inseparable condition of old age. This branch of medicine 
employs some remarkable processes, as well as herbal, mineral and metallic 
substances as tonics. Here also most of the specialized works are unavail- 
able, but a fair knowledge of the methods and drugs are obtained from the 
sections devoted to rasayana in the works of Caraka, Su^ruta and Vagbhata. 
Mercurial and other inorganic preparations of the Rasacikitsd school of 
medicine {vide later) found in Tantric works were also credited with similar 
rejuvenating powers. 

Su^ruta extols the virtues of clean living, high thinking, proper physio- 
logical habits and regular exercise, regular use of milk, pure cold water, 
honey, clarified butter, various special diets including salt-free diets, 
preparations containing gold and minerals, and various prescriptions of 
recommended drugs for rasayana.^ The mythical soma plant (yet to be 
identified with any known plant), used with auxiliary tonics and a strict 
regimen of diet and conduct, is said to bring about complete rejuvenation in 
body and mind, ensuring a fresh lease of youth.^ 

The lost texts on this subject include Sodhonatantra quoted in the 
Cakrasarngraha of Cakrapanidatta, the works attributed to Vyadi, Va^i§tha 
and Maijdavya (quoted in Rasaratndkara and Rasaratnasamuccaya and 
Ndgdrjmatantra). The last-mentioned work is by one of the many medical 
scholars in successive ages with the title of ‘Nagarjuna’. 


THE VAJlKARAYA SYSTEM 

This branch of medicine is not dealt at any length in any of the 
medical works after Caraka and Sukuta, where they are found in 

« Sen, Gananatha (2), p. 43. Ray (P. C.), p. Ixv. SS. CL, 27-29. SS. CL, 29. 



232 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


fragmentary passages.-* There is, however, unmistakable evidence of a 
considerable literature on this subject, current in the early Buddhist period. 
The famous KSmasutra of Vatsyayana gives the names of three works on this 
branch of medical knowledge, including the Kucumara tantra, which is said 
to be an exhaustive work, already ancient at the time (c. a.d. 300). 

The justification of including formulae of virilific tonics in a work 
of medicine is found in Caraka,^ where it is stated that the final metabolic 
product of all nutritive food is the seminal fluid, and the loss of the latter is 
the most serious drain possible on the body’s vitality, so that all sexual 
excesses lead to serious wasting diseases and even death unless counteracted 
by rasayana remedies. 


THE RASACIKITSA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE 

Apart from the eight classical branches of Ayurveda, some other 
indigenous systems have survived as integral parts of the medical knowledge 
of ancient India. Some of the obscure pre-Aryan concepts and practices 
have been noted earlier. The quasi-religious system of Rasacikitsd has a 
reputation second only to Ayurveda. With a few exceptions this school 
employs only metals, alloys, metallic compounds and salts and also sulphur 
and its preparations in its materia medica. According to it, quicksilver 
is the foremost among all medicinal substances. This latter belief is found 
also in many Buddhist and Brahmapic tantras, as a part of the Tan trie 
faith."^ The medical knowledge of India exported to Tibet, China, Indo- 
China and Ceylon contained much of this school of medicine mixed with 
classical Ayurveda. 

The early practitioners of this school were known as Siddhas who 
introduced many of the metallic preparations which were either unknown 
to, or not utilized in, classical Ayurvedic practice. The Tamil Sit tar works 
on medicine, chemistry and allied subjects were possibly originated by the 
Siddhas. The first use of mercurial compounds in medicine is found in 
Su§ruta (third-fourth century) here the modern and surviving name of 
mercury, parada, is used; the more ancient synonym, sutdrah, is found in 
the Susruta Sarphita,^ but its omnipotence in all diseases and indeed in all 
phases of life was first propounded in Tantric texts written by the early 
Siddhas. The alchemical preparation of gold (which also was believed 
to be an embodiment of perfection and therefore a panacea for all ills) 
from mercury was another aim of this school and many supposed processes 
to this end are found. The classical work of Madhavacarya (fourteenth 
century),^ describing the sixteen schools of belief current in his time, gives a 
description of the Raseharadarhna (faith in divine mercury), in which the 
metal is believed to be the earthly embodiment of the omnipotent deity,

Siva, and as such to be worshipped. The use of mercurial preparations 
was also beheved not only to give perfect health and cure of all diseases, 
but also prosperity, a perfect mind, bliss and eventual salvation. 

The works of the Tantric period, devoted to the preparation of inorganic 
and metallic remedies, are among the most prolific and rewarding sources 
of the knowledge of Hindu chemistry. These works were, however, 
primarily concerned with rituals, alchemy and chemical processes. Their 
value as medical literature lies chiefly in their exposition of the medical 
philosophy of this school, their iatrochemical ideas and practices, and the 
inorganic remedies they contributed to medicine. The most important 
among them are: Rasaratnakara and Arogyamanjari of Siddha Nagaijuna 
(seventh century), Siddhayoga of Vrndakunda (seventh-eighth century), 
the Cakrasamgraha and the commentaries by Cakrapanidatta (eleventh 
century), Rasahrdaya of Govinda Vagbhata (eleventh century). Rasa- 
ratndkara of Siddha Nityanatha, Rasaratnasamuccaya of Vagbhata 
(a namesake, living in the late twelfth century), Rasdrnava by Sambhu 
(twelfth century), Rasendracintamani by Ramacandra (twelfth century) 
and Rasendracuddmani by Somadeva (twelfth century). These works are 
available in most first-class collections of Ayurvedic literature in India 
and abroad. Many of them were edited and published during the last 
century, notably by the Ayurvedic Granthasala of Bombay. 

The Rasacikitsd school of medicine has been a rival of Ayurveda in 
popularity and prestige during many centuries in the past, specially in 
South India, the eastern provinces and Sind. It survives to the present 
day as a living system of medicine, but has largely discarded its deification 
of mercury and has absorbed many tenets of classical Ayurveda. The 
Kavirajas, that is medical practitioners who follow the Ayurvedic system 
of medicine in their treatment, possibly rely more on inorganic remedies 
than on the materia medica of classical Ayurveda. This preference can be 
explained by the greater facility in manipulation during compounding, 
greater portability and easier storage, easier preservation and less wastage, 
and simpHcity of prescription and dosages of inorganic remedies. 


THE N^pJvijFfANA SYSTEM OF DIAGNOSIS 

The other quasi-Ayurvedic system of importance is termed Nddivijhdna 
and, as the term implies, attaches great importance to the pulse felt at the 
wrists, a close study of which is supposed to give sufficient indications for 
the diagnosis of most diseases. The term nddi in Ayurveda means not 
only the arteries and veins but all major and minor tubes as well as nerves, 
etc., in the body; nadi does not mean the pulse in Ayurveda. Moreover, 
the very spirit of Ayurveda is opposed to the idea of putting complete 
reliance for diagnosis on the unaided touch perception of the physician. 
The earlier medical treatises recommended that while making a diagnosis 
all known factors should be taken into consideration and all the senses of the 



234 A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 

physician should be employed.® The main thesis of NafiviJMna, that 
diagnosis is possible and death predictable by feeling the pulse beats, implies 
that the condition of the heart indicates all diseased conditions, an idea open 
to doubt. On the other hand, it is quite possible that the acute perception 
of a highly trained person could discern the condition of the three do^as 
(fundamental humours) in the body which, even according to Ayurveda, 
is the basic factor in the causation, prognosis and treatment of all diseases. 
Acute perception may also predict the failure of the heart and set a period 
to the termination of its functioning. The claim of ability to foretell death 
by nadlvijndna need not be ruled out. It must also be pointed out that the 
school of nddlvijhdna does not forbid the consideration of other symptoms 
or the case history in arriving at a diagnosis; they are only considered 
much less important. 

A supposedly ancient treatise of this branch of medicine, Nadipariksa 
by Ravana (a comprehensive treatise on this subject), and another work 
Nadlvijndna, claiming to embody the teachings of Kanada and Gautama 
on this science, give us an idea of this school of medicine. The styles 
of writing of both these works do not support any claim to antiquity and 
they may be comparatively recent works, ^ at least much more recent than 
the periods of the legendary demon-king Ravana of the Rdmdyana (who is 
claimed to be the author of the first work) or even of the great philosophical 
teachings incorporated in the Car aka Samhitd and possibly the more ancient 
Agniveh Samhitd, The classical compendiums of Ayurveda do not contain 
any clear reference to nadlvijndna, and it is logical to suppose that this branch 
of medicine came into existence in much later times. The medical literature 
of the Tantras contains innumerable references to nadl but here the term has 
suffered a semantic change and generally meant nerves, which also were 
considered fundamental causative factors in diseases and bodily conditions. 


THE YOGA SCHOOL 

The Yoga system of philosophy,*^ due to Patanjali (c. second 
century b.c.), with its mental and physical discipline by the eightfold path 
of yama (abstention), niyama (observance), dsana (physical postures involving 
muscular co-ordination), prdndydma (regulation of breathing), pratydhdra 
(voluntary control of the sense-perceptions), dhydna (fixed attention), 
dhdrand (contemplation) and samddhi (ultimate and absolute mental 
concentration), is not only a philosophy but also a discipline of the body 
to make it function in a state of perfect health and flexibility. A branch 
of this discipline, known as hafhayoga, is a refined form of physical culture 
involving the voluntary as well as involuntary muscles of the body and 
claims to cure many pathological conditions. This integrated system of

MEDICINE 


235 


mental concentration, breath control, sense-control and physical culture 
can also be called a medical system. Ayurveda has not borrowed from it 
but this system has always been held in high respect in India and has 
recently earned a spate of popularity in Western countries. 


Ayurveda : theories and concepts 

DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF AYURVEDIC SCIENCE 

Ayurveda^ as has been said earlier, is not limited to mere medical 
knowledge. It wants that all men should be healthy, fit in body and keen 
in mind and that they should maintain this state as long as possible; the 
ultimate ends being mundane happiness and spiritual elevation. To 
achieve these objectives Ayurveda developed into a comprehensive encyclo- 
paedia of knowledge in medical subjects like genetics, gynaecology, 
obstetrics, aetiology', diagnosis, therapeutics, surgery, physiology, biology, 
diet, ethics, personal hygiene, preventive treatment and social medicine; 
allied subjects like animal biology, botany, cultivation, pharmacognosy, 
compounding and chemistry; and some subjects, not usually considered 
as medical, like cosmology, climatology, psychology, parapsychology, 
philosophy and religion. Mastery of Ayurveda presupposes knowledge 
in all these fields. 

Not only are the objectives and scope of Ayurveda more extensive 
than those of formal medical science; this Indian science is also distinguished 
by some fundamental theories and postulates which pervade all its precepts 
and practices, but which are not found in modern medicine. These theories 
and concepts are, however, not all archaic or even empirical; many are 
based on observations and metaphysical reasonings. These special theories 
and concepts of Ayurveda merit examination even if their correctness is 
open to question. 


COSMIC ORIGIN OF MATTER AND LIFE 

According to Ayurveda, matter, energy, sentience, life, intelligence 
and motility, all result from synthesis of ingredients evolved out of cosmic 
forces. But this synthesis is neither a matter of accident or chance nor 
the result of a slow and gradual evolution through the stages of inanimate 
matter, lower forms and less intelligent species. Every time a new life 
comes into existence inside a microscopic speck of fertilized matter, the 
mind, senses and potentiality of growth are created anew out of the funda- 
mental components present in prakrti (the ultimate ground) under the 
subtle influence of a momentary union with the puru^a (the absolute self- 
conscious principle). Prakrti which is the only source of all things which 
are perceptible to the senses or discernible to the mind has eight aspects 



236 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


and 16 mutations, all devoid of cetanS (awareness). The eight aspects are: 
avyakta (the unmanifested, ultimate ground), mahdn (ultimate experience), 
the three fundamental reals (sattva, rajas and tamas) and the three ahatfikdras 
(egos) of guidance, energy and inertia. The 16 mutations are the five 
organs of perception, five organs of action, the mind and the five tanmdtras 
(subtile essence of matter and manifestations). Consciousness and hence 
life in a living organism are the contribution of the ksetrajna (eternal, 
indestructible and ubiquitous soul) which, at the moment of conception, 
voluntarily enters into a divine, human or subhuman plane of existence 
inside a material body as karmapurusa until death separates it.® 

The eternal mother-principle, prakfti, out of which all living organisms 
are created and gain sustenance possesses three aspects; the fundamental 
gums, or reals, of sattva (tendency to manifestation, essence of intelligence 
stuff), rajas (essence of energy) and tamas (material existence, universal 
inertia). These aspects of the Ultimate Ground have the inherent poten- 
tialities of evolving into varied forms of natural phenomenon, matter, 
and animate intelligent life through innumerable permutations and combi- 
nations of the 16 mutations. The three reals are first mutated into the 
three forms of ahamkdra (ego) — spiritual ego of guidance and transformation, 
the subjective ego of energy and motion and the objective ego of mass 
and inertia. The first ego combining with the second creates the five 
organs of sense-perception (vision, hearing, smell, taste and touch), the 
five operative organs (speech, locomotion, manipulation, reproduction 
and evacuation), and also the mind which is the versatile organ. The 
third ego combining with the second creates the five tanmdtras (subtile 
particles with the potentialities of materialization and perception) which 
are the originators of the five material elements (earth or solid, water or 
liquid, air or gas, fire or energy, and ether or space) and also of the percep- 
tible phenomena of vision, sound, smell, taste and touch. Thus every 
living being is a complex aggregate in which a karmapurusa remains united 
with a material body, mind, sense organs and motile organs, contributed 
by and sustained by the 24 tattvas or prakrti} 

Hence all living organisms have a soul associated with it, a mind 
composed of the three reals, ten organs evolved out of the three egos 
(three humours which are the counterparts of the cosmic principles of air, 
dry heat and moisture) and a material body composed of the five gross 
elements present in the form of kalds (protective layers), dhdtus (component 
matters like blood, body fluids, tissues, bones, etc.), malas (eliminations 
and excretions), all functioning by the bodily counterparts of natural 
phenomena in the shapes of the three dosas (humours), agni (digestive fire) 
and kriyds (natural activities like sleep, respirations, pulsations, elimination, 
metabolic processes, etc.y Inasmuch as the fundamental components and 
primary elements constitute the living organism, each contributes its specific 
nature and properties to the individual in the proportion in which it is present.

THE COMMON CONSTITUENTS OF ALL LIVING AND NON-LIVING MATTER 

The pancabhutas (five elementary principles of earth, water, fire, air 
and space) which constitute all material substances have dififerent properties 
and characteristics. The earth principle gives mass, hardness, compactness, 
roughness, inertia, density, opacity, smell, and tactile sensations; the water 
principle gives fluidity, viscosity, coldness, softness, unctuousness, and taste; 
the energy principle gives visibility to objects, colours, periodicity of motion 
(santana), digestion, anger, instantaneous response, courage, and the visual 
sensation; the air principle gives perception by physical contact, all physical 
and physiological movements, pulsations, sense of lightness and the tactile 
sense; the ethereal or space-principle gives sound, porosity, bodily cavities, 
functional subdivisions of the bodily channels and tissues into finer and 
finer branches, and the sense of hearing.'* From these arise the infinite 
diversity of matter, some of which are predominantly composed of one 
element and some of two, three or more, with corresponding complex 
properties. Organic matter and the components of living substances (and 
plants) are generally composed of all the five elements in different propor- 
tions and possess combinations and resultants of all the material and 
physiological properties listed above. 

Living organisms also possess such resultant properties and charac- 
teristics. The sense perceptions corresponding to the five elements also 
enter into their make-up through the agency of the sense-organs, as also 
the motor activities of locomotion, manipulation, speech, reproduction and 
evacuation. All these components and attributes remain in a state of 
equilibrium and balanced existence, complementing the functions of each 
other. But the infinite number of possible combinations makes a ‘perfect’ 
organism a near impossibility. Hence health is only a state of optimum 
balance. The greater the approximation to the ideal state, the better the 
health; diseases and pathological conditions are due to imbalances and 
deficiencies of the components. These characterisitc properties, functions 
and deficiencies collectively constitute a living organism.*' 

Apart from these general attributes of non-living and living matter, 
there are certain mental components which are the special (but not exclusive) 
attributes of man. These are the emotions of pleasure and pain, voluntary 
movements, mental perception, will, logical faculty, memory, knowledge 
gained by experience and creative thinking. But even among men there are 
different combinations of the three reals constituting the mind, giving rise 
to widely different mental levels, different personalities, different abilities, 
instincts and behaviour.® 

THE THEORY OF THE MICROCOSM AND OTHER PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS 

There is a remarkable theory in Ayurveda to the effect that man is an 
epitome of the universe, a ‘microcosm’ of the macrocosm. Both the universe 

“ SS, Sa, 1. 20-21. » SS, Su., 15 ; SS. 1 and 2. « SS. Sd., 1. 18-19. 



238 A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 

and man are manifestations of one and the same eternal spirit. Spirit and 
matter are equally integrated in both. The material contents of both are 
constituted of the same five primal elements, endowing their specific and 
resultant characteristics to both. Prthvi confers the solid complement to 
both; apas the liquid; tejas (the manifestation of radiant energy) confers 
vision, body-heat and digestive fire to man; vayu enveloping and permeating 
the earth, supporting combustion, helping growth and initiating movements 
also permeates the body as vital breath and promotes growth from the foetal 
stage, and causes bodily movements; aka§a confers the orifices and empty 
spaces inside the body. Like the infinite diversity present in the universe, 
the different units comprising the body are too numerous to count. In the 
mind of man also there are as many moods as in nature. Similar to the office 
of the Brahman in the universe is that of the purusa in man; both can 
create life by the act of impregnation, both are unlimited in might and 
potentiality; the true nature of both are unknown and unknowable.® 

The concept of the ‘microcosm’ follows the philosophical doctrines 
of the Sdmkhya and Vedanta schools of Indian thought. The theories 
of cosmic evolution of matter and life and of the common constituents 
of living and non-living matter (recounted earlier) are also based on Sdrpkhya 
and Nydya-Vaiiesika doctrines. The idea of the eternal and omnipotent 
soul serving a span of existence inside an animated body, as a result of the 
residual effects of karma (deeds in previous births), is from the Nydya. 
The properties of the five primal elements and the physiological actions 
of the different taste-matters {vide later) are also found with variations 
in many schools of Indian philosophy. The basic common concepts of 
Indian philosophy have also been largely incorporated into Ayurveda. 
Ayurveda accepts that the highest aim of life is the quest for ultimate truth 
and realization ; that the perception of our senses is not valid in the absence 
of spiritual insight; that suffering is due to the human error of discrimination 
between the body and mind which suffer and the spirit which is immune; 
that the final wisdom is to shed passions and illusions; that the supreme 
essence of power and awareness is present in man, making him potentially 
omniscient and omnipotent when he achieves self-realization; and that it is 
possible for the trained mind to achieve this self-realization and salvation; a 
healthy body, long life and a keen mind being desirable aids to this end. 
These ideas are not mere abstract exercises in philosophy; they have far-reach- 
ing social, personal and medical consequences and explain the insistence in 
Ayurveda on self-discipline in all spheres of life, medical care and hygienic 
rules to keep the mind and body at the highest pitch and in perfect long life. 

GENETICS AND EMBRYOLOGY 

The purusa is infinite in number, each a disembodied soul capable 
of penetrating anywhere in space. When such a soul enters into the complex 


• C5.^d..5.

239 


of sperm and ovum, formed by the act of mating, it immediately endows 
the impregnated matter with its own attributes of consciousness, percep- 
tion, creative ability, volitional movement and the faculties of observation, 
knowledge, self-expression and self-maintenance. The three gunas also 
are imparted by the karmapuru^a^ though in varying proportions, so that 
men differ in character and ability. But the purusa, transformed into the 
individual karmapuru^a, remains unchanged in essence, because it is eternal 
and immutable.® 

This life, as we understand it, commences at the moment when the 
minute particle of fertilized ovum gains the above attributes. This particle 
is immediately propelled by vdyu into the uterus to stay there until it is again 
propelled out of the mother’s body by vdyu at the time of temporal birth.^ 

If the ksetrajna does not by its own volition enter into the zygote, 
no life is created and conception fails to occur. Hence the process of 
fertilization by the act of mating is not sufficient for the creation of life, 
though a necessary precondition, and creation of life is not possible by 
unaided human endeavour. The intervention of the unknowable soul is 
necessary. This soul creates its own body by gathering to itself the elements, 
first the dkdia and then the others in due order; but in this and subsequent 
acts in the life span, the karmapurusa is subject to certain limitations due 
to the residual effects of karma of previous births.^ 

Creation of life is possible only by the combined contributions of the 
ksetrajna and the parents who contribute their bfjas (sperm and ovum) 
containing the essence of their mental and bodily constituents (as existing 
at the time) in infinitely minute replicas. A human womb, therefore, 
invariably reproduces a human child; but temporary differences existing 
at different times and the resultant of the opposed male and female principles 
make the children differ from each other and from their parents. Such 
factors also explain male and female births (by dominance of the male or 
female bija), twin and multiple births (by fragmentation of the zygote), 
individual characteristics, abnormalities and congenital diseases (chosen 
by the karmapurusa or inherited from the parents). The growth, shape, 
energy, vigour and sense of contentment of the future individual depend 
upon nourishment and environmental factors. The mental traits are 
determined by the quota of gunas inherited from previous birth.^ 

It may be noted that this theory is in conformity with the continued 
identity of the germ-plasm through successive generations, though the actual 
individual may vary widely in mental and physical characteristics and also 
with the fact of continual mutations by accidents, infections and parental 
factors. 

THE THREE HUMOURS 

The humoral theory of Ayurveda makes a comprehensive approach 
to the three major branches of medical knowledge, namely physiology,

pathology and treatment. A proper assessment of the Ayurvedic science 
is largely dependent upon an understanding of this unified theory, and of 
the significance and real nature of the three humours. The actual term 
used in the Ayurveda is trido^a. The use of ‘humours’ to designate tridosa 
should not, however, be taken to imply that tridosa means exactly what 
humours stand for in the case of Greek or medieval European medicine. 
Despite similarities of ideas and concepts, there are important differences 
between the tridosa concept of the Ayurveda and the Greek humoral 
theory. Vdyu, pitta and kapha are supposed to be present in all living 
creatures, diffused simultaneously in every minute portion of the organism, 
and to activate and govern the entire biological process between conception 
and death. The convention of equating the three humours with air, bile 
and phlegm (possibly following Greek ideas on the subject) is misleading 
to a degree. Ayurvedic ideas represent them as manifestations of universal 
motile, fiery and placid phenomena. The normal physiological processes 
represent the normal and complementary balanced manifestations of the 
principles in the microcosm. Individual shortcomings and congenital defects 
can be ascribed to their imbalance at conception, pathological conditions 
and diseases as causal manifestations of their temporary imbalance, paucity, 
excess or derangement. Hence diseases can be cured by restoring the desired 
equilibrium or by pacification, restitution or expulsion of the offending 
dosas. These curative measures are possible by administering bhesajas 
(substances having the desired potentiality of restitution, restoration or 
pacification) and by the processes of cleansing, evacuation or surgery. 

Vdyu is self-begotten, eternal and all-pervading. Though invisible, 
it manifests itself by its properties of coldness, lightness, desiccating action, 
sound, feel, great speed, angular motion and inconceivable latent power. 
Its bodily manifestation courses through the organism in constant currents 
at high speed. If impeded in its course by any reason it becomes lodged 
in wrong places, generating progressively increasing pressures and getting 
progressively deranged. In its deranged condition it is the principal do^a, 
because it has the greatest potentiality of causing damage. In its equable 
state also it is the principal humour, for it maintains the major physiological 
functions and movements and is responsible for maintaining a desirable 
equilibrium between the humours, digestive fire, metabolic products and 
excretions. Pitta, the cosmic fiery principle, is responsible for the creation 
in the body of heat, energy, perception to all forms of radiant energy, 
vitality and blood, and the maintenance of the pumping action of the heart 
and skin temperature. Kapha or Herman supplies the placid and cooling 
principles to the body in the processes of semen formation, growth, nutrition, 
taste-perception, flushing, and lubrication between hard parts. Deranged 
pitta and kapha give rise to specific symptoms affecting the bodily elements 
in their respective spheres of influence. According to different bodily 
locations and functions, each of the humours exists in five different forms.^^

MEDICINE 


241 


Apart from a few exceptions, all individuals have a predominance of 
one of the three humours and, therefore, an inherent imbalance. The 
few exceptions and near exceptions enjoy perfect or near-perfect health 
and are immune to diseases. The others are always susceptible to diseases 
due to the ever-present possibility of aggravating the inherent imbalances, 
but normally remain tolerably healthy as long as the humours are not 
provoked by injudicious diet, wrong conduct or environmental conditions 
which are at variance with their individual humoral states. For example, 
if a person with excess of vdyu indulges in foods and acts which provoke 
that humour, this humour is deranged and afflicts the person with mental 
or physical disorders peculiar to this humour. The same holds true for 
pitta and ilesman. The individual types are much less affected and may, 
in fact, be benefited by indulging in foods and acts which provoke the other 
two humours. The distinctive aetiology and prognosis of different diseases 
are due to the large number of possible permutations and combinations 
of the three humours, each with five varieties, multiplicity of functions 
and different possible degrees of provocation. Diseases are minor, major 
or incurable, according to the degrees of humoral derangement. Logically, 
the cure lies in primarily detecting the deranged humour or humours and 
assessing the severity of derangement, and secondarily in identifying the 
specific malady by case history and symptoms. Armed with this knowledge 
and with the varied drugs and processes at his command, the physician 
can apply his knowledge of medical science to correct the specific imbalances 
and aggravations and ultimately effect a cure.® 

Ayurveda recognizes infections and infectivity, but it holds that the 
infecting agent is not the real or intrinsic cause of the disease, but only a 
remote cause. The infecting agent, like all other outside adverse agents, 
upsets the unstable equilibrium of the dosas in the first instance; this in 
turn acts on the dhdtus, producing the disease and its symptoms.^ 

DIGESTION, METABOLISM AND ELIMINATION 

According to Ayurveda, life and the biological processes are dependent 
upon the production of heat inside the organism. This body-heat comes 
out of food which also nourishes and maintains the organism through its 
metabolic transformations. Ingested food and drink pass into the stomach, 
become minutely dispersed by the digestive fluid present there, and their 
assimilable contents turn into a sweet, frothy, mucus-like fluid. This 
process of digestion, carried out by agni (digestive fire), continues until 
the fluid becomes acid, issues out of the stomach and excites the secretion 
of thin bile. At this stage it is an assimilable, nutritive fluid known as 
rasa, which is pumped by the heart through 24 major channels and permeates 
the entire system. Rasa constantly moistens, nourishes, maintains and 
irrigates the organism by processes which are not completely understood. 

« C5. 15. 13-40; 55’. M., 1.

It also tranquillizes, lubricates and vitalizes the body. While flowing through 
the liver and spleen it obtains a red colouring matter; this coloured modi- 
fication of the potent rasa is known as rakta (blood).“ 

Blood is the first metabolic transformation of the rasa^ which is there- 
after successively converted into flesh, fat, bone, bone-marrow and, finally, 
semen. These seven elementary bodily constituents are the seven dhatus, 
orginating in the nutritive fluid produced from food. 

There are many by-products from this chain of metabolic transfor- 
mations. Apart from body-heat there is artava (a special and fiery variety 
of blood) formed periodically in women between 12 and 50; ojas (essence of 
vitality), a white, unctuous, cool fluid which gives vital power, strength, 
activity, good voice, bright complexion and acuteness of the senses; breast- 
milk formed in mothers and valuable for nourishment of the child. The 
metabolic processes terminate in the openings of the body, each of which 
has its specific mala (excretions). Apart from menstrual fluid and breast- 
milk formed only in women, the malas are urine, stool, sweat, the excretion 
from the eyes, ears, nose, mouth and hair follicles. Hair, bodily hair and 
nails arc also malas. Unlike dhdtus, which are produced according to bodily 
requirements, malas are produced according to the quantity and quality 
of food, and according to age, bodily size and physical condition.^ 

The bodily elements are replenished by the rasa and other dhdtus and 
are maintained in a proper condition by gathering the necessary ingredients 
directly from rasa^ and indirectly from food and assimilated drugs and 
passing out the excess matter and unwanted constituents. This replenish- 
ment and maintenance is a normal and self-regulating process when the 
various metabolic processes go on without interruption or obstruction 
through their allotted channels. Blocking, depletion or over-production 
of any metabolic product prevents proper nourishment and leads to patho- 
logical conditions by obstructing or upsetting the humoral balance. Treat- 
ment in such cases, and also for non-elimination of malas, consists in 
rectification, restoration or elimination by proper dieting, use of suitable 
drugs relieving blocked channels, therapeutic processes, blood-letting and 
other forms of surgery. Food being at one end of a metabolic chain and 
eliminations on the other, improper or obstructed elimination require as 
much attention as any other metabolic disturbance. 

MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY 

According to Ayurveda, medical treatment should be oriented not 
only to diseases but also to the patient and the prevalent climate, season 
and environmental factors. In fact, the patient is considered to be the 
premier factor in deciding upon a course of treatment. Different treatments 
are necessary for patients of different ages, sexes, races, castes, habits, 
habitat, diets, physical conditions, physiological constitutions, vitality, 

« CS. CL, 15 ; SS. Sii., 14. ^ CS. Sii., 28 ; SS. Su., 14 and 15.

MEDICINE 


243 


appetites and metabolisms, even when their symptoms are identical. A 
proper case history should include all these factors. There is also the 
possibility of a hereditary malady which requires different treatment from 
an acquired condition with the same symptoms. A patient who has 
suddenly changed his place of residence, or his accustomed diet, or has been 
exposed to an unaccustomed climate, also requires special treatment. A 
physician should also be under no illusion about the special difficulties 
involved in treating noblemen, high-ranking officers of the State, learned 
pundits, persons with high-strung nerves, laymen with pretensions to medical 
knowledge, sly or secretive persons, persons without relatives or friends, 
destitutes, persons lacking self-control, sex-conscious women, very old people 
and infants.® 

Persons with certain anatomical features, like disproportionately 
short necks, wide shoulders, muscular chests, large faces and foreheads, 
deep voice and deep inspirations while breathing, are generally immune to 
diseases and respond quickly to medical treatment. They are generally 
long-lived. But persons with prominent noses, eyes with tendency to roll, 
narrow backs, chests covered with curly hair, and unusually large generative 
organs, are prone to diseases and respond very tardily to treatment. They 
are generally short-lived. Persons with none of these features are average. 
The first type requires simple and minimum treatment while the second 
requires careful, intensive and prolonged treatments.^ 


MAINTENANCE OF HEALTH 

It has been said earlier that diseases are the results of aggravation of 
the humours, and that an inherent imbalance of the humours in greater 
or lesser degree is present in all human beings, mih potentiality of aggra- 
vation by wrong food, practices, accidents, etc. The best way to avoid 
diseases, therefore, is to keep a strict check on diet, habits and hazards which 
are likely to cause such aggravation. Similarly the best way to gain in 
health and vigour, both physical and mental, is to live in such a way that 
the inherent humoral imbalance is gradually rectified or counterbalanced. 
With these ends in view, Ayurveda has formulated an extensive series of rules 
concerning daily and seasonal diets, routine, and conduct which can maintain, 
and gradually improve, physical health and mental level, ward off senile 
decay and promote longevity. 

Meticulous cleansing and ablutions are given a special importance in 
such routines. The locations of the body where the dosas can be easily 
provoked or get blocked are to be cleaned daily. These include the teeth, 
tongue, oral cavity, throat, eyes and the entire skin surface. The free 
movement of the three humours, blood and other bodily fluids can be 
assured by regular and regulated physical exercise avoiding overstrain and 
exhaustion. Walking is recommended as a good form of exercise. The 


® SS, Su., 10 . 6 - 7 .

244

malas of the body (including nails and unwanted hair) should be regularly 
eliminated or removed. Shoes, umbrellas, headgear and clothing should 
be used against accidental injuries and harmful exposure, both of which 
aggravate the humours. Living-rooms and beds should be designed to 
the same ends and to secure the best in relaxation and sleep, both of which 
can correct humoral derangements. Habits which aggravate the humours, 
or conduct which provokes them or leads to accidental injuries (which can 
rapidly derange the humours), should be avoided; those which rectify, 
should be cultivated. Diets and habits should always be adjusted to 
seasonal, climatic and geographical factors.® 

Ayurvedic texts give detailed descriptions of the physiological actions 
of all edible and potable substances, even organic substances used for 
smoking purposes. Such lists and descriptions make the selections of 
diets for all types of personal requirements quite easy. The different 
tastes of all foods and drugs are given special importance for indicating 
their potentiality to augment or rectify the do?as. This is said to be due 
to the fact that the specific tastes (the bland neutral taste exemplified by 
water; six pure tastes, e.g. sweet, sour, saline, bitter, pungent and astringent; 
and their combinations taking two, three, four, five and all at a time, making 
63 tastes in all) emerge in different substances from the collocations in 
different combinations and proportions of the five primal elements comprising 
them, these elements having intrinsic properties which can augment, rectify 
or counterbalance the different humours.*^ It follows that a judicious 
selection of edible and potable substances from the different taste groups can 
maintain health and cure diseases.^^ 

All Ayurvedic texts agree that forcible suppression of natural urges — 
vomiting tendency, sneezing, hunger, thirst, sleep and breathing — lead to 
immediate and mounting aggravation of the do^as. Sudden changes of 
temperature, prolonged exposure to intense cold, heat or glare, long spells 
of strenuous work, over-exercise, carrying heavy loads, personal encounters 
with stronger enemies, falls from mounts, violent emotions, mental shocks 
and improper sexual practices have same effects in a greater degree. All 
these should be carefully avoided by persons desiring health.*^ 

SLEEP AND DREAMS 

The phenomena of sleep and temporary loss of external consciousness 
have exercised the imaginations of natural philosophers from the earliest 
times in all countries. Modern science has many theories on the subjects, 
but the real nature of sleep, dreams and the unconscious state is not yet 
understood. It is therefore of great interest to know what Ayurveda has 
to say about these mysterious, twilight periods of human existence. 

According to the Su^ruta Samhitdj nidrd (sleep) is a natural function 
of all living creatures and occurs whenever the centre of consciousness

(cetand) is overpowered by an accumulation of tamos (essence of inertia). 
In this condition the sensory channels of the body are blocked by Herman 
of a special variety containing abnormal amounts of the tdmasika (inertia) 
principle which has accumulated. In sleep, the jivdtmd {karmapuru§a) 
which never sleeps may give glimpses of occurrences and experiences of 
previous existences to the rdjasika (active) principle of the mind in the form 
of dreams. The rdjasika principle being the essence of energy and activity 
retains some of its consciousness even in the pathological state of sleep, 
but is unable to bring back the normal state of consciousness.® In sleep the 
soul may also give indications of physical weakness, ill health, impending 
diseases or death, also in the form of dreams, to the semi-awake rdjasika 
principle. Normal consciousness returns when the sensory channels have 
been freed by the agency of the sdttvika (conscious and transforming) 
principle and the being awakes from sleep.^ 

When sdttvika and rdjasika principles are feeble and subdued by any 
reason, the second fails to maintain partial and potential consciousness 
and the first to carry out its awakening function. This lasts until these 
principles are restored to strength and the organism remains in a state of 
tdmasika nidrd (sleep pervaded by inertia) in the form of unconsciousness 
or coma. This condition, though apparently akin to deep sleep, is quite 
different from the latter. In tdmasika nidrd, the accumulation of inertia 
and slesman of the tdmasika type may be so great that it is prolonged 
indefinitely or permanently, culminating in death.® 


Ayurveda : practice and application 

ETIflCS OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION 

A practitioner in Ayurvedic medicine was expected to be a qualified 
person in all senses of the term. The qualities demanded for this calling 
were self-control, courage, compassion, integrity of character, keen intelli- 
gence, retentive memory, insight, acuteness of perception, purity of mind 
and body and, of course, a thorough knowledge of the theoretical, textual 
and practical branches of medical science. These qualities were assured 
as far as possible by limiting studentship to healthy, well-born youths who 
could be expected to have the proper potentialities and special aptitudes 
for learning. The student graduated into the profession only after a long 
period of study and practical training under competent, inspiring teachers. 
The intending physician was free to choose a particular branch of Ayurvedic 
knowledge as his special field, but was required also to have an adequate 
knowledge of the other branches and as much as possible of other sciences 
and philosophies which help in giving a comprehensive grasp of Ayurveda 
and the real significance of its diverse informations and its philosophical

basis. Before starting practice he had to demonstrate beyond all doubt 
that he had thoroughly mastered his subject and had been properly trained 
in making independent observations and practical applications of his 
knowledge. Only then was he given permission to practise independently. 
A State licence was also required.® 

Aspirations to success, wealth and fame were considered normal on 
the part of a physician, but obligations to society and patients must always 
have prior claims. Desertion of, or injury to, patients under any circum- 
stance was strictly forbidden. A physician’s duty is to treat all deserving 
persons to the best of his ability. But habitual sinners, morally degraded 
and depraved persons and professional killers (even of animals) were not 
considered deserving persons.*’ 

When a physician takes up a case, he should whole-heartedly apply 
all his skill, faculties and knowledge to his work. He should remember 
that patients trust their physicians implicitly to the extent of placing their 
lives unhesitatingly under his care. This is true even of patients who have 
no trust in their own relations, parents and children. Hence a physician 
should take as much care of each and every patient as he would of his own 
child.® He may, however, refuse to take up cases where the disease appears 
to be incurable.^ 

The physician was expected to place the maximum facilities possible 
at the disposal of his patients, maintain a nursing home and dispensary, 
prepare medical prescriptions from raw materials under his own super- 
vision and arrange for the services of nurses and qualified attendants.® 
In private practice, he must not enter a residential house without proper 
introduction, nor attend a woman in the absence of her husband or guardian. 
He must not also say or do anything which might give a mental shock to 
the patient or to the relatives and friends of the patients. He must not 
divulge any information he had learned in his professional capacity.-^ 

A physician should remain a learner all his life, gaining experience, 
knowledge and understanding all the time. He should discuss problems 
with other physicians and take part in debates and discussions. He is 
expected to lead a disciplined and unostentatious life, to be pleasant in 
his manners and speech, and considerate in all matters. Friendship towards 
all, compassion for the ailing, devotion to his noble profession and a 
philosophical attitude to cases with fatal endings — these are declared to 
be the four corner-stones of medical practice.^

aggravation due to inherent imbalance of humours. Hence Ayurveda has 
classified diseases by the humour affected (also in some cases by blood, 
which can be vitiated), and also by the causes which can trigger off such 
aggravations. 

Classified according to humours (or blood), diseases are of the following 
types: due to vayu, due to pitta, due to slesman, due to blood, due to two 
of them at a time, and due to three of them at a time. When all the three 
humours are deranged simultaneously, the disease is of the sannipatika 
type and expected to be severe or even fatal. Classified according to the 
causes which aggravate the imbalance, all deviations from the healthy 
state are of three types. The first type, adhyatmika (generated inside the 
organism or the mind), can be of three origins: adibaJapravrtta (inherited 
from the stage of ^ptwa-ovvirv^janmabalapravrtta (acquired after conception 
but before birth, from the mother, her behaviour and other environmental 
factors) and dosabalapravrtta (caused during life by improper conduct, 
diet, etc.). The second type, adhibhautika (due to adverse outside causes), 
can be of two origins; samghatabalapravrtta (due to painful physical 
contacts, accidents, poisonous bites, etc.) and kdlabalapravrtta (due to 
abnormal or climatic conditions). The third type, ddhidaivika (due to fate, 
malign influences and other unknown reasons), can also have two origins: 
daivabalapravrtta (providential, caused by ‘acts of God‘, demoniac influences, 
charms, spells, natural calamities and epidemic diseases) and svabhdva- 
balapravrtta (caused by factors which become inevitable with time, like 
sleep, hunger, thirst, senility and death). 

The above classification is found in the Susruta Samhitd.^ The Caraka 
Satnhitd gives only three major origins: nijasarlradosaja (of humoral origin, 
generated inside the body), dgantuja (communicated from outside) and 
manasa (mental diseases).* The later texts by Vaghhafa, Madhava, 
Cakrapanidatta, etc., also give elaborate classifications and subclassifica- 
tions on the general lines given by Su§ruta but differing in details and 
nomenclature. 

All the major texts are also in agreement regarding the principles on 
which diagnosis is possible, though in some cases like the Madhavanidana, 
many chapters are devoted to a learned elaboration of the simple principles. 
In every case the aetiology, symptoms and prognosis are to be studied and 
compared to those described in the authoritative texts for different diseases. 
But, in diagnosis, the personal factors which cannot possibly be found in 
texts are of major importance. The patient’s age, social status, heredity, 
usual residence, occupation, physical features, hardiness, vitality, habits, 
accustomed diet and usual appetite form the background which has to be 
filled in by interrogation and detailed personal examination by the physician 
who is advised to take the maximum help from his own trained senses. 
The physician should carefully observe the patient’s present appearance, 
vitality, voice, acuteness of sense perceptions, clarity of mind, memory.

Eny sbnorniElity of bchEviour, intestinfll snd other sounds, pulse, skin, 
bodily excretions, etc. When necessaiy, a sample of blood should be 
drawn and subjected to certain tests. Latent symptoms should be brought 
to the surface by provocative medication.® 

Even with all the above knowledge at his command, the physician 
can make a correct diagnosis and decide upon a course of treatment, only 
if he has the mental calibre to apply properly his theoretical knowledge 
(which should be accurate and extensive) of all diseases and their different 
complications. He should have at his finger-tips the knowledge of the 
specific sources, exciting factors, preliminary indications, concomitant 
symptoms, possible complications and aggravations, variations of symptoms 
according to degrees of severity, period of duration and indications of 
recovery or imminence of a fatal end.^ The physician should remember that 
some pathological symptoms are secondary effects of other diseases and 
may occur either simultaneously with the original disease resulting in a 
confusion of symptoms, or become apparent after the original malady 
subsides.® 

Though the above-mentioned personal factors are all important in 
diagnosis there are certain rational principles on which a diagnosis is to be 
based. These principles are too technical to be discussed here. The reader 
is referred to any reliable edition of Rugvinikaya by Madhavakara, popularly 
known as Madhavanidana, for a masterly discussion of these principles. 

Though symptoms are generally valuable only as indicatives in diagnosis, 
the physicians should remember that in some cases the specific symptoms 
(or secondary symptoms) can become so violent and harmful that they 
should be checked first by any means, as otherwise they may prove more 
harmful than the disease itself. Symptoms are of three classes; purvarupa 
(indicatory symptoms pointing to a future malady, latent in the system), 
prdk'kevala (specific symptoms appearing along with the onset of the 
disease) and aupasargika (secondary symptoms not specific to the disease, 
which may develop during the course of disease or after the latter has run 
its course).^* 


GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF TREATMENT 

Treatment in Ayurveda is fundamentally a process of restoration and 
building up, consisting largely of elimination of undesirable ingredients 
and replacing them (and also inherent deficiency) by desirable ingredients 
from outside. Except in emergencies, medical measures have always the 
long-term aim of restoring the lost equilibrium of dosas and dhatuSy or of 
stabilizing any imbalance which may be present in a state of apparent health. 
All drugs and medicinal measures, as also surgery, are employed to these 
ends; so also are diet and conduct recommended to the patient. In 
pursuance of these aims, Ayurveda makes no distinction between hygienic

MEDICINE 


249 


measures, preventive medication and therapeutics, or between items of 
diet and oral medicine. 

Food, drugs, therapeutical and surgical measures, daily routine in 
health and medical measures in sickness— all are, therefore, oriented to 
the paramount need of creating an equilibrium of the gums, do^as, dhatus 
and malas, individually and jointly. Only then it is possible to uproot 
the causes of the disease. These ideas apply equally to the mind and the 

body; for in the case of the mind the equilibrium can be similarly upset 

by an imbalance of the gums beyond normal levels. Mental treatment, 
therefore, requires psychic catharsis and spiritual rebuilding. 

As stated previously, the actual medical measures depend upon the 
disease; and diagnosis depends upon a host of variable factors most of 
which are individual. Though there cannot naturally be any hard and 

fast rules, there are certain common denominators in the Ayurvedic 

treatment of all pathological conditions. These are samsodham (cleansing 
and evacuative processes), samsamana (tranquilization and rectification 
of humours and dhatus), ahdra (proper drugs taken orally, and diet) and 
dcdra (correct conduct and medical regime). All these apply equally to 
physical and mental processes, which also must be purified, tranquilized, 
fed with proper ideas and trained to think in proper lines. So in Ayurveda 
prayers, propitiation, spiritual guidance, exorcism of evil influences, etc., 
are of as much importance as medical measures.® 

Public hygiene is also not neglected in Ayurveda, People are urged 
to avoid all filth like offal, broken fragments and dirty grounds. Blowing 
or picking the nose in public and committing nuisance on a public road 
are forbidden. Dirty and inadequate dress, crude habits of eating, drunken- 
ness, gambling and associating with prostitutes are considered unhealthy 
practices to be strictly avoided.^ 

The dictum of Manu® not to pollute public waters is in conformity with 
Ayurvedic teachings. Contaminated waters and waters of public baths are 
recognized as major sources of ill health and epidemics, and the use of only 
clean and pure water from natural sources is recommended in all the texts. 


SPECIAL METHODS OF TREATMENT IN AYURVEDA 

It has been said earlier that all substances are potentially medicinal 
drugs as they partake of the properties of the elements constituting them. 
But the selection of any food or drug in any disease, or for maintaining 
health, depend upon whether it contains the qualities sought for correcting 
the humoral state. The intrinsic qualities of all substances are taste, 
assimilability, potency, physical properties and specific physiological or 
therapeutic action. All these qualities have to be considered in selection; 
but taste, assimilability and therapeutic action are more important than 
the other two.** When a single substance is not available to satisfy all the 

“ Aft. Hr. Su., l \SS.Su.,\. b cs. S6., 8. ^ MS., IV. 56. ^ CS. Su., 26. 



250 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


desired qualities (as it is very often the case), more than one material is 
used in combination to meet the ends. Thus arise the yogas or prescriptions 
containing a multiplicity of drugs. 

The four initial requirements of Ayurvedic treatment are good physi- 
cians, good nurse-attendants, good medicines and methods, and obedient 
patients. 

Among specific therapeutic methods, regular cleansing of accumulated 
bodily wastes and of internal organs get the pride of place in Ayurveda. 
Other methods (apart from oral medication which is the most common) 
include eye-drops, eye-salves; gurgles, fumigation of the ear, nose and 
throat areas;® liquid unguents, lotions, creams, skin salves, ointments, 
medicated oils, medicated clarified butter, etc., for the skin surface;*' supposi- 
tories, tampons, soaked cotton swabs for the bodily openings; enemas, 
douches, etc., applied by catheter tubes, douche-cans, etc., for the rectal, 
vaginal and urethral passages;^ sun-bath, steam, steaming decoctions, hot air 
and hot surfaces, hot immersion baths, hot fomentation, etc., for sudation 
and cleansing the skin pores and fomentation with absorbable drugs, 
mud-packs and poultices for local medication. The use of water sterilized 
by boiling or immersion of hot substances,^ antisepsis by fumigation with 
benzoin group of drugs, arsenic compounds, use of hypertonic salt solutions 
for surgical dressings, astringents as styptics for bleeding wounds and 
abrasions, use of cautery, intense cold and tying blood vessels in uncontroll- 
able haemorrhage and use of alcohol for inducing anaesthesia are found 
scattered in the texts. 

Psychiatric methods^ are also among the special methods of 
Ayurveda. 


AYURVEDIC SURGERY 

The high achievements of Ayurvedic surgery have been described 
in an earlier section. The general excellence of Ayurvedic surgery is 
attested by the remarkably rational concepts and scientific methods found 
in the texts. Details of such methods are naturally out of place here. 

According to SuSruta, surgery is the best, quickest and generally the 
most successful method of treatment,^ as it involves total removal of the 
diseased or morbid accumulations of dosasy dhatus and malas and gives the 
organism a better chance to acquire a new equilibrium by post-surgical 
medication to replenish the removed tissues, fluids, secretions, etc. Surgical 
treatment, according to Ayurveda, is not limited to the use of surgical 
instruments alone but a complete course of treatment, including diagnosis, 
preparatory methods and measures, actual operation and post-surgical 
methods, to aid healing and restoration of health.*

The Susruta Samhitd recommends the use of bandages, splints, padding 
materials, plugs, lints, tourniquets, ligatures, horse-mane, human hair, 
silk and other threads, boiling and cold water, honey, milk, clarified butter, 
vegetable oils, pulverized cereals soaked in water, caustic and mild alkalis, 
heated metals, astringent pastes and solutions, setting plasters, ointments 
and alcoholic liquids as aids in surgical processes. For the different types 
of surgical processes (listed as incision, excision, scraping and softening 
of epidermic layers, puncturing, probing, extraction, draining and suturing) 
used for various conditions requiring surgery, 24 different manipulative 
methods (including sucking out, flushing, compression, wrenching, injec- 
tions, etc.) are described. A great variety of surgical instruments including 
scalpels, razors, saws, probes, needles, hooks, forceps, pincers, hammers, 
tubular appliances, hollow hemispheres, horn instruments, speculums, 
etc., made of tempered hardened iron and other metals are described.® 


AYURVEDIC MATERIA MEDIC A 

Plant and Animal Substances 

The materia medica of Ayurveda is extensive, and utilizes substances 
from the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms. The humoral conception 
of the diseases and their remedies together made this extensive materia 
medica logical and even compulsory. For, according to the basic theory, 
the different properties and constitutions of all different substances made 
them valuable in some condition or other. A study of the Ayurvedic 
texts makes it clear that the drugs included had each been selected after 
careful clinical experiments and long experience. The specific properties 
like taste, assimilability, potency, physiological actions are descriW in 
almost all cases. 

These experiments were naturally conducted mainly with materials 
available in the environment, which explains the strong preference shown 
by classical Ayurveda for plant remedies of the indigenous varieties. A 
second reason for this preference was that the plants being composed of 
all the five elements (according to the pdficabhautika theory) had a natural 
flexibility and wider range of application, compared to inorganic matters 
composed of the earth element only. This advantage was shared by animal 
products but their use was limited by availability and variety, and possibly 
by lesser efficiency in actual application. A statistical break-up of the 
materia medica in the Caraka Sarnhitd shows 341 plant-substances, 177 
drugs of animal origin and 64 mineral substances, metals, etc.*' The 
corresponding numbers for the Susruta Samhitd are 395, 57 and 64 respec- 
tively. The animal products are found less and less in the later works. 
These numbers no doubt reflect their tradition-cwm-availability and also 
efficacy in comparison with each other. But in the case of inorganic 


55.5fi.,7and8.

252 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


remedies, the choice was limited to the few locally available metals 
and minerals, the synthesis of new inorganic compounds being still 
unknown. 

Plants provided the natural and traditional drugs for most oral and 
non-oral medication. A clear understanding of their properties had led 
to their rational classification into different groups according to therapeutic 
actions. A list found in Caraka gives 50 different groups.® But in spite of 
the wide range of available varieties, many conditions required more than 
one drug, sometimes of different groups, sometimes in combination with 
animal and mineral matters also. This multiplicity of drugs for a single 
disease was based not only on theory but also on experience. If both (or all 
three, four, etc.) had been found valuable for various conditions, of a 
disease, it was quite logical to use all of them at the onset of a disease, 
when the prognosis was still not known. In this way, with new experiments 
and new clinical experience through centuries, more and more ingredients 
would enter into a single prescription, in the hope of possible benefit to 
the patient, due to inherent conservatism, and finally due to the supposed 
sanctity of written texts. Nothing would be dropped out against the new 
additions, and prescriptions sometimes grew to alarming proportions, 
containing literally hundreds of ingredients. To manage into homogenous 
form different solid, squashy, semi-solid and liquid substances, a great 
deal of compounding skill had to be brought into play. Even in the earliest 
texts we find elaborate directions for extracting the active constituents of 
organic substances and homogenizing them. Thus developed the remark- 
able and elaborate processes met with in the samhitas. Many of them have 
survived unchanged and form part of modern Ayurvedic pharmacological 
practice. They are named and sometimes described in detail in various 
passages while giving instructions for compounding prescriptions or extract- 
ing drugs from crude materials. They include the processes of solution, 
maceration, trituration, extraction with water, preparation of tinctures, 
preparation of emulsions, or solutions in oily liquids, extraction of essential 
oils and juices, pasting, coagulation, filtration, decantation, sedimentation, 
dilution, concentration, precipitation, gel formation, desiccation, dehy- 
dration, percolation, evaporation, distillation, fractionation, sublimation, 
steaming, combustion, chemical combination, etc. Actual weights and 
volumes were obtained by balances and measuring vessels, and a large 
number of other apparatus were used.*' But all these methods were those 
of the pharmacy. There is little evidence of synthetic preparations of either 
inorganic or organic compounds. Processes for the dissolution of finely 
divided iron, gold, silver, gems, minerals, etc., in vegetable acids for medicinal 
preparations arc found in some passages. The use of mercury is referred 
to in the Susruta Samhitd, but only as an ingredient of a cosmetic 
preparation.^

Inorganic and Metallic Remedies 

After the age of Caraka and Susruta we find a steadily increasing comple- 
ment of inorganic substances among Ayurvedic medicines. The incoming 
materials differed from the readily available and naturally occurring inorganic 
substances mentioned in the earlier works; most of them were synthetic 
substances or minerals and ores transformed by chemical processes or 
metallurgical treatment. The beginning of this trend is found in Vaghhafa’s 
works. These inorganic medicaments got a fillip from the researches of 
many generations of alchemists and iatrochemists who discovered many 
valuable chemical and metallurgical processes and devised new and work- 
manlike apparatus for their work. How these substances came to be 
used as medicines cannot now be ascertained with any accuracy, but the 
‘philosophy of mercury’ and the prestiges of Vfnda and Cakrapanidatta 
who first gave them a status as medicine must have helped. The advantages 
which gave these medicines an ever-increasing popularity among medical 
practitioners during the centuries have been recounted earlier. Another 
possible reason was that they often proved valuable in conditions which 
would otherwise have needed surgery, for which there was a growing 
distaste in the profession. 

The processes and apparatus devised during this age belong properly 
to the history of chemistry in India. The mercurial preparations, however, 
occupy a special position in this field and a short account of them will 
furnish a sample of the notions and methods of Ayurvedic chemistry of the 
Rasacikitsa school. 

Mercury of a pure variety was obtained by the dry distillation of pure 
hingula (cinnabar, HgS) in a retort and collecting the vapours in cold water 
{Rasaratnasamuccaya quoted in Sir P. C. Ray’s work). Mercury obtained 
from impure cinnabar or imported from outside contained toxic matters, 
lead, tin and other impurities and required re-purification to make it fit 
for internal medication. This purification was done by trituration in a 
mortar with certain (named) vegetable juices in several repeated operations, 
each alternated with washing by portions of cold water. It was finally 
distilled thrice in a clean retort and receiver luted with clay. 

Mercury is said to be ‘solidified’ by rubbing with gold or silver giving 
a bright, brittle, solid product. It can also be ‘solidified’ by roasting in a 
covered crucible with its own weight of sulphur and one-eighth its weight 
of gold. (These processes would not really result in the solidification of 
the liquid metal; by the first process mercury will be converted into an 
amalgam and by the second into a pasty mixture of the metal and its 
sulphide.)® 

Mercury is said to be ‘incinerated into an ash’ by prolonged trituration 
with certain mixtures containing oils and juices of vegetables, followed by 
heating the mixture in a covered crucible.^ (The ‘incineration’ of mercury 


Ray(P. C.), 1, p.54;U, p. 4. 


^ Op, cit., I, pp. 73-74. 



254 A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 

into an ash is prima facie impossible; the metal may be converted into solid 
crystallizablc derivatives by these processes.) Cinnabar, heated in a closed 
crucible with other plants, is said to give powdered ashes of mercury. By 
triturating the metal with yet other plant juices, alternatingly heating and 
cooling the mixture seven times, and finally heating in a closed crucible with 
fresh quantities of the plant juices is said to result in a salt-like ash of mercury. 

Mercury is said to be ‘killed* by distilling with an excess of sulphur. 
The red-brown sublimate of mercuric sulphide is known as rasasindura or 
makaradhvaja and is believed to be a highly potent remedy for many 
diseases and for senile decay. Mercury heated on a sand bath with twice 
its weight of resublimed sulphur, and one-eighth its weight of pure gold is 
known as siddha-makaradhvaja supposed to be comparable to ambrosia 
in its efficiency. Some later works of the same Rasa school are rightly 
sceptical about the incorporation of gold into the sublimed product. They 
believe that gold is simply left behind, and hence it makes no difference 
whether gold is used or not, and that there is no difference between the 
two varieties of makaradhvaja. The varieties of makaradhvaja are fairly 
representative examples of this class of medicines. After many centuries 
of experience, their efficacy is no longer open to question, though not all 
that it is claimed to be. Their use has survived up to modern times. 


VETERINARY SCIENCES 

The description of Ayurveda as a comprehensive science of life and 
not as mere medical science is further justified by the existence of branches 
dealing with the welfare and treatment of other living creatures besides 
human beings and even of trees. This inclusion is logical, for, according 
to Ayurvedic treatises, the raison d'etre of this science lies in compassion 
for all forms of suffering. On a more practical plane also, the proper 
care of livestock and economic vegetation was highly important to a non- 
industrial economy based on natural resources and on animals for nutrition 
power and transport. A knowledge of the level of veterinary knowledge in 
ancient India is obtained from specialized and individual treatises dealing 
with cows, horses and elephants. The Rajamartanday an encyclopaedia 
of medical knowledge by Bhojaraja (available in a printed edition published 
by the Ayurveda Granthamala series, Bombay), contains extracts from the 
above treatises and also deals with water-buffaloes, deer, dogs, falcons, 
pigeons, etc. The Yogasudhanidhi by Vandimi^ra® contains a chapter of 
conception, obstetrics and special diseases of female animals. 

BOVINE AYVRVEDA 

The nutritional and therapeutic values of milk are described even in 
the earliest Vedic literature. T^e Suiruta Samhitd gives a detailed account 


Sen, Gananath (2), p. 76. 



MEDICINE 


255 


of similar values of milks of other animals and the products obtained 
from them.® This and other passages scattered in Ayurvedic works refer 
to examination and care of milch cows. A treatise dealing exclusively with 
Gavdyurveda (medical knowledge concerning bovine animals), attributed to 
Gotama, must have been current up to the middle ages, as quotations from 
it are found in the Rdjarndrtanda, but no authentic version is known at the 
present time. This treatise contained information relating to mating, stud 
bulls, calving, possible retention of the placenta, lactation, sources of 
contamination of milk and insuring the best quality of milk, diet in health, 
diseases and pregnancy, and bovine ailments in the shape of fevers, gastro- 
intestinal troubles, skin affections, ulceration of udders, loss of milk, sterility, 
etc., and their treatments. 


EQUINE AYURVEDA 

The Samhitd of Salihotra, an ancient and famous treatise dealing 
exclusively with horses, of which extracts are found in the Agnipurdno, 
was, according to some, redacted by Kalhana (twelfth century) under the 
title SdUhotrasdrasamuccaya} A translation in Arabic of either the 
original work or its redaction was made in the age of the Caliphs of Baghdad, 
and was known as Sdldtor. Other important editions or redactions of 
this work are Asmvaidyaka by Jayadattasuri and Ahahtra by Nakula. 
The first work is a large volume of 68 chapters dealing with many topics, 
including separate chapters on different breed of horses; their characteristics 
according to age, sex and breed; the features to be desired or preferred 
in horses for riding, for drawing carriages and for stud purposes; foaling: 
lactation; diet; various types of internal medicines and external applications 
for equine diseases like cough, indigestion, diarrhoea, skin diseases, apoplexy 
madness, etc.; and surgical operations for treatments of malformations, 
diseased conditions castration, etc. The medical and surgical methods follow 
the classical precepts of Ayurveda. Nakula’s work is remarkable for its 
coloured illustrations of horses and knowledge of equine anatomy. It is 
also a valuable compendium of many branches of knowledge relating to 
horses. An Ayurvedic lexicon, also credited to Nakula, named Cikitsd 
Samgraha, contains a glossary of terms and materia medica relating to this 
branch of knowledge. Bhojaraja’s encyclopaedia quotes also passages from 
HayalildvatJndmasarngraha by Jayadeva, Vdjlcikitsd Samgraha by Jayadatta, 
and Sdrasamgraha, an anthology of different works on this subject, by 
Nakula. These works are of minor importance and are also rare or 
unavailable. 


AYURVEDA OF ELEPHANTS 

In ancient India elephants were in constant use for military purposes, 
as mounts and for moving heavy loads. The care of elephants became

256 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


naturally an important branch of veterinary science. An exhaustive treatise 
on Hastyayurveda (Ayurveda of pachyderms), rivalling the Caraka Sarnhit& 
in bulk, is attributed to the sage Palakapya, but it may be the work of one 
of his disciples, for it is, like the Caraka Samhitd, written in the form of 
questions and answers between the sage and his disciple Romapada.® 
This branch of medical knowledge is also based on the tridosa theory of 
origins, symptoms and treatments of diseases. The Palakapya Samhita 
is divided into four sections, maharogasthdna (on major ailments), ksudra- 
rogasthdna (on minor ailments), ialyasthdna (on surgical treatment) and 
uttarasthdna (detailed treatment of some topics), and includes chapters on 
anatomy, physiology, habits, mating habits, seasonal changes, stabling, 
food, sterility and madness of elephants. The symptoms of diseases and 
their treatment and the prognosis of imminent death of elephants are also 
discussed in the text. 


PLANT AYURVEDA 

The terms v(k^dyurveda (science of life of trees), gulmavrk^dyurveda 
(science of plant life) and bhesajavidyd (science of medicinal plants) occur 
in ancient works like the Arthasastray Agnipurdna and Bchatsamhitd, and 
refer to selection and procurement of viable seeds, choice of proper soil, 
irrigation, manuring, sowing and germination of seeds, planting, grafting, 
pruning, layering, seasonal care, cultivation, rotation of crops, climatic 
conditions in relation to proper growth, classification and identification 
of plants, aesthetic and hygienic values of gardens, construction of 
herbariums and the treatment of plants in healthy and diseased conditions. 
Many of these topics can be classed as medical knowledge relating to 
plants. This unique branch of Ayurveda survives now only in scattered 
references in the above works and specially in a chapter of the compre- 
hensive medical treatise by Sarngadhara (thirteenth century) entitled 
Upavanavinoda. 

The Su^ruta Samhita mentions the respective roles of seeds, climatic 
conditions, soil and water in the germination of plants.^ Upaskdra by 
Sahkarami^ra, displays an intimate knowledge of botany in stating that 
‘water poured at the roots goes upwards and laterally through the interior 
of a tree, where neither impulse, nor impact, nor even the solar rays 
can cause the movement; the coherent medium of water and causative 
living soul in the trees and plants make the moisture rise upwards and the 
trees grow’. The Brhatsarnhitd, Manusamhitd and Arthaidstra contain 
practical methods for propagation and reproduction of plant, though the 
phenomenon of sexual reproduction in plants was not realized. An extensive 
nomenclature of thousands of types of trees and plants is found in all 
relevant works, but the classification of flora was based not on families and 
genus but on external or floral characters and medidnal or dietic values.^’

The etiology, diagnosis and treatment of plant diseases (and also of plant 
blights and sterility) are dealt with in the Upavanavinoda, mentioned 
above, which also contains chapters on classification of plants, selection 
and sowing of seeds, watering and care of plants, recipes for nourishing 
(culture) solutions, and difterent methods of propagation, including 
bijaruha (by seeds), mulaja (by roots), skandhaja (by cutting operations), 
skandharopanlya (by grafting and layering), agravfja (by apices) and by 
parnayoni (inside leaves). It also contains some interesting speculations 
on the possibility of creating new species of plants with desired scents 
and colours in its products, anticipating the modern science of applied 
biology by nearly two thousand years. 

SPREAD OF AYURVEDA OUTSIDE INDIA 

THE AYURVEDA IN ANCIENT IRAN AND THE HELLENIC COUNTRIES 

It has been noted earlier that there is a close analogy between the 
medical traditions of the two branches of the Indo-Aryan family in Iran 
and India. Even after the period of the Veda and the later Avesta, many 
of the basic conceptions are found to be the same, due perhaps to close 
communication between the two, though the methods of treatment and 
theories of medicine differ.® 

An ancient Mesopotamian medical manual, possibly dating back to 
the Hammurabian period (c. 2000 B.c.), contains many medical concepts 
which reappear in changed but unmistakable forms in Indian Ayurveda 
and the Hippocratic tracts on medicine. The supposed special symptoms 
of imminent death, found in this work, are found in a modified form in 
Pre-notions de cos, Coan prognoses and Prorrhelique /. They are also found, 
though in a less archaic and empirical form, in practically all Ayurvedic 
texts.* This general concordance between the ancient Mesopotamian 
system and the later Indian and Greek ones is also strikingly observed in the 
case of symptoms of demonic possessions, specially of children. But, in 
this case, the On the Sacred Diseases of the Hippocratic collection gives 
examples and symptoms but rejects the theory of supernatural origin. 
As far as these and some other common ideas are concerned, there is no 
reason to believe that such ideas originated in Indian medicine and was 
transmitted to Greece or vice versa. 

But many other concepts of Greek medicine are extremely likely to 
have been Indian in origin and development and are likely to have been 
propagated by the spread of Indian medical ideas in many countries, by 
direct contacts, and by indirect communications. In the case of Greece 
there was communication from very early times, at least as far back as

the fourth century B.c., even before Alexander the Great invaded the Indus 
valley (327 b.c.)* His army physicians did not know any cures for snake- 
bites and other diseases endemic to the area. Indian doctors were called 
in and some of them later accompanied the returning army back to Greece.® 
Thus began the spread of Ayurveda in the Hellenic Empire, though frag- 
ments of Ayurveda knowledge must have found their way earlier through 
Iran and the maritime trade routes, as shown by the fact that substances like 
pepper, cardamoms, musk-root plant, indigo and cane-sugar, indigenous to 
India at that time, are found among the earliest exports of India to Greek 
ports. 

The clear enunciation of the theory of an internal and vital organic 
breath (akin to the cosmic wind) as the cause of all motor activity of the 
living body and its involuntary muscles, as well as that of movements of 
fluids circulating inside the body, is part of the ancient works Bhela 
Samhitd^ and Agnivesa Samhitd. A much less precise version of this thesis 
is found in the Hippocratic texts On Breaths, where bodily wind is simply 
stated to be ‘ the cause of the principal phenomenons which accompany the 
fevers, shivering, trembling, yawning, resolution of articulation, transpira- 
tion, etc.’^ The Hippocratic tracts had their origin mainly between the 
fourth century b.c. and third century a.d., and do not antedate the Bhela 
Samhitd and the Agnivem Samhitd. The treatment of this theme in the 
Caraka and the Susruta is much more elaborate and sophisticated, showing 
a gradual local development. Many scholars trot out the theory of later 
interpolations or even past forgeries when Indian texts show a higher 
development in any concept compared to later or contemporary Greek texts. 
These arguments, however, can cut both ways. Again, the typically Indian 
concept, found in many basic Indian philosophies of ancient origin, of the 
creation of the embryo at the moment of conception, by the simultaneous 
congress of the purusa (self-existent eternal soul), the vital breath, the 
parental semen and the maternal seed, is found in a somewhat changed 
form in the Hippocratic text. On the Nature of a Child. In this latter 
work, the mention of a maternal ‘semen’ is unique in Greek medicine, 
though the idea is very common in Ayurvedic texts. The reference to 
purusa as an ingredient is also lacking. The ideas of the vital breath 
starting at the moment of conception to build up the anatomy and 
physiology of the foetus from the fundamental elements is also found in 
the texts On the Embryo of Eight Months and in On Flesh. But the details 
about the instantaneous commencement and the ingredients are lacking. 
The idea of the mother’s vital breath, found in all Ayurvedic texts, circulating 
also through the embryo is also found in the Embryo of Eight Months, 
but the details about the embryonic heart, embryonic blood-circulation 
and nutrition are lacking. The attribution of diseases of the nervous system 
to obstructed and vitiated wind is a special and remarkable theory of 
Ayurveda. In On Diet in Acute Diseases, only a few such diseases like

sudden loss of speech, giddiness, convulsions, etc., are attributed to obstructed 
wind without formation of any coherent theory. It is logical to suppose 
that these ideas which are found developing progressively in Indian medical 
literature were not Greek in origin and further that they were imported into 
Greece along with many other Ayurvedic concepts, some clearly discernible, 
others changed beyond possible recognition. 

The humoral theory of origin of diseases is another instance in point. 
There is a steady development of this concept, beginning with a mere 
mention in the Rgveda\ follow'ed by the enumeration of the three humours 
in the Atharvaveda; then a visible and clear formation of the theory in the 
Atharvaveda-parisista (a later appendage of the Atharvaveda in the latest 
period of Vedic literature); then its emergence as a comprehensive theory 
of causation, symptoms and treatments of diseases in the Bhela Sanihitd; 
and finally its all-embracing form in the Caraka and Susruta Samhitds as a 
complete explanation of all vital processes, their imbalances and their 
cure. It is possible that the Greek development of the theory was inde- 
pendent of India. But as it is found in Greek texts in less sophisticated 
and less complete forms in all comparable periods, the presumption that 
it travelled from India to Greece is justified. The time lag explains the 
lacunae and imperfections in the Greek theory and also the somewhat 
irrational addition of blood, one of the visible bodily fluids, as the fourth 
humour. 

Megasthenes, the Greek ambassador to India towards the end of 
the fourth century b.c., tells us how the diseases of elephants are to be 
cured, and gives prescriptions which are clearly borrowed from the 
Hastydyurveda of Palakapya.® The Ayurvedic dry pippall (long pepper), 
used in prescriptions for the eyes, is metamorphosed in the Greek manual. 
On Woman's Diseases, as the Median medicine peperi for the eyes, and in 
On the Nature of Woman it is midikhoi medicine and not acknowledged 
as indikhot (Indian). Other passages in the former text confirm that 
Median is a wrong reading for Indian.^ These and many other facts and 
logical inferences prove that Ayurveda spread into Greece and the Greeks 
were perhaps unaware that they were using borrowed concepts and data. 
The reverse process has also probably occurred in many instances. 

THE AYURVEDA IN THE ARABIC WORLD 

The spread of Ayurveda in Arabic countries is well authenticated and 
not based on inferences. Due to the meticulous habit of Arabian scholars 
of keeping complete records of historical and cultural events, it has been 
possible to get a clear picture of the prestige and popularity of Indian 
medicine in this area from historic times. The considerable amount of 
surviving literature in Arabic and Persian on medicine contains many 
translations from Indian treatises and much material that is directly utilized

from them. The medical scholars of the two lands, who travelled freely 
from one country to the other before and after the Islamic conquest of 
India, have contributed much to a mutual enrichment of knowledge. The 
science that the Arabs carried with them in their far-flung empire must have 
contained a fair amount of Indian contribution, specially in medicine, just 
as they brought much of Syrian and Greek science to their Indian Empire. 

The Arabs established trading centres in the Malabar Coast of South 
India in the seventh century and carried away spices, dyes, drugs and scent 
materials to their other centres in Asia, Asia Minor, Africa and Europe. 
This made the world of Arab trade conscious of the quality of Indian drugs. 
In the eighth century the Arabs conquered the Indian province of Sind. 
The cultural genius of the Abbasid rulers, curious about the long reputation 
of Indian science and specially Indian medicine, began to send scholars 
to India and invite Indian scholars to visit them. Thus began an exchange 
of scientific ideas, by direct contact, between the two countries in philosophy, 
mathematics, astronomy, chemistry, metallurgy and medicine.^ A later 
Abbasid Caliph, Harun al-Rashid, was famous for his patronage of learning 
and science. He actively encouraged the learning of the Indian system 
of medicine and caused some of the classical treatises of India to be 
translated into Arabic. An emigrant Indian medical scholar became the 
physician-in-chief of the State dispensary after he was ‘successful in curing 
his royal patient of a long-standing stomach trouble’. This Indian scholar 
translated the Susruta Samhita into Arabic under the title of Kilal-SamuraU 
hind-i of ‘Susrud’. The famous scholar Ali ibn Zain translated the Caraka 
Samhita into Arabic as the treatise of ‘Sarag’. In later years the Niddna 
of Madhava was translated under the title Badan and the Astdhgahrdaya 
as Astankar, These Arabic works were also retranslated into Persian. 
The Ayurveda thus became a well-known science in Arabia whence it spread 
into Persia, Turkey, Egypt and the Mediterranean countries, which passed 
under Arab domination in later ages. 

Nearer home, the influence of Ayurvedic system in Iran, even before 
its conquest by the Arabs, has been clearly established. The Iranian king, 
Chosroes I (a.d. 531-579), had a physician named Burzuya who had brought 
a version of the Paheatantra, the Indian Book of Fables, into Iran after a 
journey to India. The autobiography of this physician contains a summary 
of embryology which has been recognized by Hertel as containing typically 
Indian notions. Burzuya, for example, says that delivery is caused by a 
wind— and this is ‘precisely the teaching of classical Indian medicine’. 
It is, of course, not unlikely that this Indian idea was not introduced by 
Burzuya, but had reached Iran even before his time, for there is positive 
evidence of the Indian influence on the famous medical school established 
in the fifth century a.d. at Gundesapur in Susiana by the Nestorians expelled 
from the Byzantine Empire. It is interesting to note in this connection 
that in the chapter dealing with the functions of the ‘wind’ in the existing

text of the Caraka Samhita, mention is made of the presence of Kahkayana, 
the physician from Bahlika (BMikabhisaj), in an assembly of learned men 
gathered round Master Atreya. Bahlika or Bactria, on the other side of 
the Hindu Kush mountains, was included in the dominions of Chosroes I. 
Apart from the writings of Burzuya, this Indian legend has preserved the 
reminiscence of the close contact between the Iranian and Indian doctors.® 

There is more direct evidence of the influence of Ayurveda further 
east in Central Asia. Modern archaeological excavations have unearthed 
the remains of a large number of ancient cities that lay buried deep under 
the sands for more than a thousand years, along the trade route from Bactria 
to China passing between the Tien Shan mountains in the north and the 
desert of Taklamakan in the south. Many of these old cities were Indian 
settlements in the early centuries of the Christian era. One of them — Kuchi 
or modern Kucha — was an important centre of Buddhism and, according 
to Chinese records, there were nearly 10,000 stupas and temples in this 
kingdom at the beginning of the fourth century a.d. An Indian became 
the preceptor of the local king. Music and other arts and sciences of 
India flourished in this region. The famous manuscript, known after its 
founder as Bower Manuscript, was recovered from this region.^ It 
contains seven Sanskrit texts, of which three are medical treatises. The 
first deals with the wonderful properties of lasum and other roots and herbs, 
particularly in curing eye-diseases. The second, Navamtaka, is a voluminous 
text divided into 14 chapters. The third text contains medical formulas 
in 72 verses. Another work dealing with spells and charms as antidote 
against snake-bite is also of semi-medical character.^ Several other manu- 
scripts of medical texts have also been found, including a Kuchean transla- 
tion of a collection of Sanskrit text and a part of a bilingual manuscript 
(original Sanskrit text with Kuchean translation) of Yogasataka ascribed to 
Nagarjuna or Vararuci. 

The influence of Ayurveda is also clearly traceable in Tibet. A large 
number of medical texts in Sanskrit were translated into Tibetan in the 
eighth century a.d., and there is no doubt that the medical system in Tibet 
was derived mainly from Ayurveda. To mention only a few similarities, 
reference may be made to the nine openings and 900 nerves in a body, the 
theory of three humours, the injury caused by taking together fish and milk, 
and the use of certain herbs and plants as drugs. Several Tibetan medical 
works were translated into Mongolian, and the Tibetan medical system, 
based on Ayurveda, was adopted by various hill tribes of the Himalayas 
near Tibet.*^ Indian drugs were known in China, Korea and Japan. 

The Hindus who established colonies, kingdoms and empires in Indo- 
China and Indonesia during the first millennium of the Christian era also 
introduced the knowledge of Ayurveda in these regions. The medical 
treatise of Su^ruta is referred to in an inscription of Cambodia (Kambuja)

in the last decade of the ninth century a.d. The Grand Monarch Jaya- 
varman VII of Kambuja (a.d. 1181-1281) established 102 hospitals 
(Arogyasalas) in his kingdom, and an inscription gives in 23 Sanskrit verses 
a detailed account of diet and medicinal herbs supplied to these hospitals. 

The Burmans also adopted the Ayurvedic system to a large extent. 
Though the Susruta and other Ayurvedic works were not translated from 
Sanskrit into Burmese before the eighteenth century a.d., the Burman 
technical terms in medicine were derived from Sanskrit. 

The Ayurvedic system was introduced into Ceylon by the Buddhist 
missionaries in the early centuries of the Christian era, or possibly even 
earlier. But, apart from the mention of Saratthasamgraha in the Culavamia, 
the oldest medical work, Yogarnava, belongs to the thirteenth century. 
The modern printed works and manuscripts of medical texts in the British 
Museum are all based on Sanskrit works on Ayurveda. 


THE Ayurveda in the middle age (a.d. 1200 - 1800 ) 

STATIC PERIOD OF AYVRVEDA 

The beginning of the thirteenth century a.d. is generally taken to mark 
the end of the ancient period of Indian culture, though a period of transition 
had begun many centuries previously. This date, a.d. 1200, is also signi- 
ficant in the history of Indian medical science, as it marked the end of an 
era of growth and standardization. At this period, the classical treatises 
of Caraka and Susruta had already become hoary with age; it had been 
necessary to revise the archaic matter and restore parts which had been 
lost or misplaced. The later works of Vaghha^a, Madhava and Cakrapani 
also held high places in professional esteem but, due to the highly conser- 
vative cultural traditions of India, the older classics had not been pushed 
aside in favour of the more concise and better written later treatises. 
Besides these, many other commentaries, specialized works on the eight 
branches of Ayurvedic knowledge, anthologies and lexicons held the field 
and served the needs of medical men throughout the political and cultural 
sphere of Indian influence. Apart from the emergence of some new 
remedies in the Tantric works and the Rasadkitsd school, nothing challenged 
the dominance of Ayurveda. Its prestige was not confined to India. 
Through missionaries, visiting scholars and emigrant doctors, and by the 
written word, it had penetrated to the far corners of the known world, 
from Mongolia in the north to Ceylon in the south, and from Eastern 
Mediterranean countries in the west to the Indies in the east. Adoption 
of Indian drugs, methods, and theories in these lands and the translation of 
Indian medical works in many languages testify to the fact that Ayurveda was 
one of the foremost medical systems prevalent in the world at that period. 

In A.D. 1200 then, Ayurveda had long reached its peak, but the intel- 
lectual energy and creative research which had contributed to its growth 



MEDICINE 


263 


and vigour were definitely things of the past; so also were dispensaries, 
hospitals and medical services maintained at State expense by past Buddhist 
and Hindu monarchs. The new generations of medical students had to 
depend upon largely on their personal teachers for practical and theoretical 
training, augmented no doubt by the great treatises. The main prerequisite 
of sustained intellectual development — prestige and security of the intel- 
lectual and professional classes in a politically stable and progressive 
society — was gone; for India was constantly overrun by powerful foreign 
hordes. The martial classes not only ruled the land; they had replaced 
the intellectuals as the dominant class in the social hierarchy. 

It would be, however, an unjustified oversimplification to ascribe 
this static condition and the later stagnation and decay of Ayurveda solely 
to political reasons. The seeds of decay lay inherent in Indian thinking, 
religious beliefs and social system, and these profoundly affected the Indian 
sciences themselves; and medical science was no exception. The intellectual 
curiosity and passion for experimental research, which were associated 
with the Tantric and Rasehara faiths, also petered out due to the same 
inherited factors. 

But, during the broad period of Indian history (a.d. 1200-1800), the 
residual impulse of the vigorous medical systems of the earlier ages produced 
an impressive array of valuable secondary works before reaching almost 
complete inertia. This inertia was helped by the adoption of Unani 
(originally Arabic) medicine as the system recognized by the ruling power 
along with a passive neglect of Ayurveda. This loss of prestige was followed, 
as we shall see, by a loss of popularity as well, during the last centuries 
of this period. 


AYURVEDIC WORKS IN THE MIDDLE AGE 

Many scholarly works on Ayurveda proper were written during these 
six centuries. One of the earliest was the Samhita of Sarngadhara (thirteenth 
century), which, for the first time in the history of Ayurvedic works, includes 
opium in the materia medica, possibly following Chinese or Arabic practice; 
mercurial and other metallic compounds are also freely used in the text. 
A voluminous and possibly later treatise is by Vangasena, with the title 
Cikitsdsamgraha. This work, which is not to be confused with an earlier 
work of the same name by Cakrapanidatta, has always been known as 
Vangasena, possibly to avoid this confusion. It has been a popular 
handbook in Bengal for many centuries and is available in all respectable 
collections. The author claims in a concluding colophon that his work 
is a redaction of an earlier samhita by the sage Agastya of South India 
fame and the legendary originator of the Sittar school of pseudo medicine. 
But, though it contains many prescriptions from this school, its language and 
presentation prove its later date of composition.® The Yogaratndkara,

A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


another comprehensive and monumental treatise on Ayurveda by an unknown 
author, has been popular in South India for many centuries; its chemical 
methods for preparing drugs are extremely valuable. Possibly the most 
renowned work during this period is that of Bhavami^ra (fifteenth-sixteenth 
century). This work, Bhdvaprakdsa, contains an exhaustive list of diseases 
and their symptoms and a complete list of drugs current in his time. This 
encyclopaedia includes the aetiology and treatment of syphilis, a disease 
introduced into India by Portuguese seamen in the fifteenth century. Its list 
of drugs includes many that were not previously included in Indian medicinal 
usage, including metallic preparations and imported drugs. 

Another class of medical works, which had existed from earlier times 
but which became increasingly important as handbooks in medical practice 
during this period, were the nighantus (ready guides or lexicons), which 
contained long or short monographs on different medicinal substances 
and terms. The works of this period were by Madanapala, Narahari, 
Bhimapala and Rajavallabha, which supplemented or supplanted earlier 
works by Dhanvantari, Halayudha, Vi^vadeva, Amara, §e?araja, Sodhala, 
Madhava and Cakrapanidatta. None of these works claim any originality 
in matter or presentation of theoretical knowledge. Among specialized 
treatises of this period may be named Arkaprakdsa by Ravana, of unknown 
age (possibly of a date not later than the twelfth century as indicated by the 
style of writing), dealing with aqueous and tinctorial extracts; CikitsdkaJikd 
by Tri^ata (fourteenth century), a manual on diagnosis; Cintdniam by 
Ballabhendra (fifteenth-sixteenth century), another comprehensive work 
on aetiology and diagnosis of diseases and clinical examination of the bodily 
eliminations; Vaidydmrta by More^vara (early sixteenth century), dealing 
with treatment of diseases only; and Vaidya-Jfvam by Lolimbaraja 
(seventeenth century), dealing with the clinical and therapeutical aspects 
of marital relations. Most of the works mentioned above are available 
only in manuscript form. An assessment of these works has been given 
by Gananath Sen (2) and Keith (3). 

WORKS ON RASACIKITSA AND lATROCHEMISTRY 

The works of the Rasaeikitsd school of this period compare favourably, 
in material and presentation, with earlier works of this branch of medical 
and chemical knowledge. Rasaratndkara, the monumental work by Siddha 
Nityanatha in five volumes, was the earliest work of this period, though it 
might have been composed in the last years of the ancient period. It is a 
compendium of medical knowledge pertaining to this non-Ayurvedic 
school and deals with non-mercurial metallic compounds, mercurial 
preparations, therapeutic actions and rejuvenating effects of such prepara- 
tions and the religious faith of the Rasaeikitsd school. Rasasdra and 
Rasahrdayatantray two important works on alchemy and mercurial prepara- 
tions, are widely believed to have been written by Govinda BhSgavata 
PadScarya, the preceptor of Sankaracarya (ninth century), but they are very

possibly the works of another later Govinda Bhagavata (c. thirteenth 
century) of Gujarat. The Rasendrasarasamgraha by Gopalakrsna (fourteenth 
century) has been a favourite book for inorganic remedies in North 
India and Eastern India for many centuries. The Dhdturatnamdla by 
Devadatta (fourteenth century) — a complete manuscript is available in the 
Palace Library, Bikaneer — describes the winning of metals from native 
ores and their conversion into oxides, carbonates and salts by oxidative 
methods and action of mineral acids. Rasavatara, a voluminous treatise 
by an unknown author of unknown date, and Parada Samhitd by Niranjan 
Prasad Gupta (eighteenth century or earlier) are informative treatises on the 
mercurial faith, mercurial remedies and the Rasa school of medicine. 

During the latter part of the period under review, a combination of 
adverse political, social and economic factors gradually undermined the 
reputation and usefulness of Sanskrit-based learning, and the old cultural 
achievements fell into disrepute. Physicians, who also had to be erudite 
scholars in many branches of philosophy and sciences as required by 
classical Ayurveda, seldom found satisfactory successors, for the new 
generations were gradually losing their mastery over the archaic phraseology 
of the Ayurvedic texts; apart from a working knowledge of diagnosis and 
drugs suitable for treatment, many of them did not have any acquaintance 
with the concepts and theories which formed the basis of Ayurveda. Replace- 
ment of existing texts by new copies which had to be laboriously done by 
hand had long ceased to be an economic proposition, no new works were 
being written and the old copies were getting scarce due to natural decay 
in a damp and humid climate. The very basis, on which knowledge could 
be standardized and passed on, was tottering. There were also no hospitals, 
no medical colleges, no forums of discussions and, needless to say, no 
research in Ayurveda, The noble profession gradually passed from erudite 
scientists into the hands of semi-ignorant people with only hearsay knowledge 
or knowledge gathered from an imperfect comprehension of incomplete and 
incorrect texts. The members of families of long lines of Ayurvedic 
practitioners, often foremost in education and aptitude in their society 
due to centuries of family tradition in a scientific profession, quickly found 
other and more lucrative professions. Not knowing Sanskrit they considered 
the manuscripts of their forefathers as useless lumber. 

The long and rigorous training in theory, medicine and surgery, 
compulsory in classical times,® gave place to a few years of apprenticeship 
as compounder-cw/n-assistant. The new entrants to the professions were 
very little interested except in methods of easy cure and were psychologically 
inclined to follow the path of least resistance. Actual dissections on 
cadavers, so necessary for surgical and anatomical knowledge,* had been 
discontinued for many centuries due to changed ideas of caste purity, and 
surgery was avoided or relegated to barbers when absolutely unavoidable. 
Obstetric practice was shunned by the male physicians due to changed ideas of

social intercourse and was relegated to untrained and illiterate midwives with 
horribly insanitary and often highly harmful methods. The teachings of the 
classical works regarding detailed examination of bodily eliminations and 
applications of douches, enemas, etc., were conveniently forgotten; for social 
and caste considerations, as well as prudery, dictated against such methods. 
The painstaking methods of diagnosis found in Ayurveda were replaced 
by diagnosis on the basis of case history and feeling the patient’s pulse; 
the equally painstaking methods of treatment often became limited to oral 
medication. In the latter sphere, the metallic preparations alone were 
reliable, as the original pharmacognosy of plant drugs had long been 
forgotten and rubbish offered by traders was often passed on as genuine; 
for genuine prescriptions were costly to collect, prepare and store. When 
results were disappointing, the science had to take the blame and people 
turned more and more to the newly imported Western science of medicine 
in hope of cure. 

That Ayurveda did not completely die out in these circumstances is a 
great tribute to its intrinsic merit and vitality. 


PRESENT CONDITION OF AYURVEDA 

In spite of its glorious career both in India and outside for more than 
two millenniums, Ayurveda has fallen on evil days and evil tongues. This 
is, of course, mainly due to the greater importance attached to the allopathic 
treatment introduced in this country during the British rule in the second 
quarter of the nineteenth century. The people of India hailed the new 
system as more scientific than Ayurveda, as there has been no development 
in the latter for wellnigh thousand years, and it has failed to take advantage 
of the modern scientific inventions and appliances. As a consequence of 
this, Ayurveda did not enjoy the patronage of the government. While 
medical colleges and hospitals were established all over India during the 
British rule, there were no such government institutions for the Ayurvedic 
system until recently, though a few have been established entirely through 
private efforts. An attempt to place the education and practice of the 
Ayurveda as well as the Siddha and Unani systems in a proper footing 
was made by the Madras Government through the establishment in 1924-25 
of the Government School of Indian Medicine. Shortly afterwards similar 
efforts were made by Bihar, the United Provinces, the Punjab, Bombay and 
other provincial governments. The situation has not improved very much 
even after the achievement of independence in 1947. 

But though the Ayurvedic system has languished, it is still a living 
force. A large majority of Indians, specially the rural and poorer people 
in urban areas, take Ayurvedic medicines. It is also a happy fact that 
a galaxy of brilliant Vaids and Kavirajas (practitioners in Ayurveda), 
whose name and fame spread all over India, has revived the importance and 
popularity of the Ayurvedic system. Thus, in spite of the apathy of the 



MEDICINE 


267 


government and a section of the people, Ayurveda has held its ground all over 
India, thanks to the private patronage and financial help from Indian States. 

Reference may be made to a few private Ayurvedic institutions referred 
to above. Gurukul Ayurveda University, Kangri, is the most famous 
and there are Ayurvedic colleges and ^ols where the pure Ayurvedic system 
is taught in the old orthodox style. But a new turn was given to the system 
of instruction towards the end of the nineteenth century by the efforts of a 
number of allopathic doctors who were also trained in Ayurvedic system 
and actually practised it. As a result, Astanga Ayurveda College with 
hospitals was established by Kaviraj Jaminibhusan Ray with a handsome 
donation and gift of land. Thereafter, the Visvanatha Ayurveda Maha- 
vidyalaya, Vaidya Sastra Pitha and Maharaj Kasimbazar Govinda Sundarl 
Ayurvedic College were established respectively by M. M. Kaviraj Gananath 
Sen, Kaviraj Syamadas Vacaspati and Kaviraj Ram Candra Mullick. 
It was thought fit and proper to follow a mixed syllabus, both in theory 
and practice, giving rise to what is known as the integrated system. It has 
produced a class of practitioners who use both Ayurvedic and allopathic 
medicines. In this way the influence of allopathy has entered into the 
precincts of Ayurveda all over the country. 

Opinions differ as to the propriety and usefulness of the integrated 
system. It is held by some that the products of this system acquire no deep 
knowledge of Ayurveda, i.e. treatment and preparation of medicine, and, 
what is worse, use allopathic medicines under the disguise of Ayurveda 
without mastering the rudiments of allopathy. The mischief, they hold, 
is mainly due to the fact that those who administer the Medical Department, 
including the integrated system, are all allopathic doctors without any 
knowledge of Ayurveda, 

On the other hand, it is argued by others that in the present scientific 
age, State recognition should not be extended to a system of medical treat- 
ment which does not lake cognizance of the modern developments in our 
knowledge of anatomy, chemistry, biochemistry, physiology and other 
allied sciences, or of such ‘precision’ methods for probing the human malady 
as are offered by thermometer, stethoscope, X-ray, microscope, test of 
blood, stool and urine, etc. The absence of surgery is also a great drawback 
in Ayurvedic treatment. 

It is an intriguing problem of which no easy or immediate solution 
seems to be at hand. Nevertheless, the fact remains that Ayurvedic 
system is still a living one and is likely to retain its popularity among the 
masses and even a section of the educated classes, save for such diseases 
as malaria, typhoid, kala-azar, smallpox, cholera, plague, etc., for which 
successful specific remedies have been discovered in modern days. It is 
but fit and proper, therefore, that the State should take adequate steps 
to ensure a good training in the purely Ayurvedic system for those who 
seek it. The government should provide adequate resources for the 
improvement of teaching on purely Ayurvedic syllabus, make proper 
arrangements for preparation of all sorts of Ayurvedic medicines and

experiment in Ayurvedic laboratories under eminent Ayurvedic physicians, 
and provide for proper training in all the departments of Ayurveda for 
students having proficiency in Sanskrit, by sanctioning proper emoluments 
and salary for the staff, etc. Perhaps the problem of an integrated medical 
system, referred to above, would be easier to solve if highly efficient Ayur- 
vedic colleges grow side by side with the existing medical colleges.

The system of the healing art known in India as the Umni Tibb is

and medical men. They call it ‘Arabian’ because they had received it 
through the Arabic medical writers. The Indians call it Umni because 
it is mainly based on the Greek system which was founded by Hippocrates 
and developed by Aristotle, Galen and other Greek writers. The Arabic 
medical writers, having taken it from the Greeks, developed it further in 
the light of Persian medical traditions and of the Indian system of medicine, 
modified and improved it as a result of their own observation and 
experience, and handed it down to the posterity. Hippocrates has been 
accepted as the father of Greek medicine. To him is attributed the Greek 
humoral theory which laid down that the living organism consisted of four 
humours— blood, phlegm, black bile and yellow bile. Each of them 
consisted of four elements — fire, water, air and earth, each of which 
possessed some particular quality — heat, coolness, dryness and humidity. 
The organism and its single parts possess these essential qualities. The 
essential factor in life is the natural heat, the seat of which is the left heart. 
It prevades the entire organism. If the humours and their elements are in 
proper proportions and are properly mingled, the organism enjoys perfect 
health, and, if it is disturbed due to internal or external causes, disease sets 
in. The natural heat tries to combat it. It is the duty of the physician 
to help the natural healing power of the organism by suitable medicine 
when necessary and not to supersede or impede it. The therapeutics of 
Hippocrates was not bound by any fixed rules. It was essentially indi- 
vidualistic. According to him the physician should treat the sick and not 
the sickness. 

From the end of the seventh century, the Muslim Caliphs and their 
courtiers began to take active interest in Greek philosophy and science 
in general and in Greek medicine in particular. They collected together 
the masters of Greek medicine from the various parts of their dominions 
and Greek medical works from their own dominions as well as from foreign 
countries. They also invited several Indian medical men to their capital. 
In less than a century they got translated into Arabic most of the Greek 
and several of the important Indian medical works. Under their patronage

the Arabs, as well as the non-Arabs, the Muslim and the non-Muslims 
began serious study of these medical works from the ninth century and 
continued it on a wide scale for many centuries, the main centres of their 
activities being Baghdad, Damascus, Cairo, Cordova and various other 
capitals of Islamic dominions. During this period they adapted, sum- 
marized, commented upon and made certain important additions to the 
Greek system of medicine as a result of their own observations and experience 
of medical cases. 

The earliest of the independent Arabic medical writers was Ali b. 
Rabban, who, in a.d. 850, in his book, FirdausuUHikmat (Paradise of 
Wisdom), summarized the whole system of Greek medicine as well as 
the Indian system of medicine on the basis of four important Indian medical 
works— Ciiraka, Susruta, Nidana and Astangahrdaya. After him, his 
student, Abu Bakr Muhammad b. Zakariyya ar-Razi (Rhazes of Medieval 
Europe), who died in the first quarter of the tenth century, made a thorough 
study of both the systems, had been in charge of many hospitals, introduced 
in them the system of keeping complete records of each case, and, in his 
methods of teaching medicine, attached great importance to practical 
training of its student. This method was adopted by other physicians also. 

But the pride of place among the Arabic medical writers belongs to 
Abu ‘Ali Husain b. Abdallah b. Sina (Avicenna) (a.d. 980-1036). His 
Qanun {Canon) was accepted as the most authoritative medical work in 
Europe for five centuries (twelfth-seventeenth century). And it is accepted 
as the greatest authority on the Unani Tibb in India up to the present day. 
He composed 99 books, some of which occupied more than 20 volumes. 
Sixteen of his books deal with medical subject. The most important of 
them is the Canon on medicine. 

Both before and after Avicenna, a large number of medical men in 
the various parts of Muslim dominions produced, in Arabic or Persian, 
a large number of medical books according to Greek system, adapting or 
changing or improving its theory or practice in the light of their own 
experience. They anticipated the so-called modern theory of the circulation 
of blood as well as the germ theory. They made great strides in sympto- 
matology, in special pathology, epidemiology, opthalmology, dietetics, 
toxicology and midwifery. They pointed out the connection between 
exophthalmos and goitre, introduced the process of bleeding for the treat- 
ment of cerebral haemorrhage and apoplexy, performed gastric lavage, used 
opotherapy, and could keep a patient unconscious for seven days. They 
invented many delicate surgical instruments, performed the amputation 
of the ovula and the excision of the whole tongue, removed the diseased 
bone from the skull and replaced it by that of a dog. They made important 
independent contributions to therapeutics, pharmacy and pharmaceutical 
techniques, and used many drugs and chemicals which were entirely un- 
known to the Greeks.®

A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


The Greek medicine, thus largely improved, partly modified and better 
systematized by the Arabic medical writers than by the Greeks, was carried 
to Europe during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The same system 
was brought to India by the Muslims in the eleventh century and cultivated 
and followed throughout the century for 800 years side by side with the 
Ayurvedic system. Perhaps India is the only country in which the two 
ancient systems of medicine are still in vogue side by side with the modern 
allopathic system. 

The Muslim rulers of India and of its various parts were highly interested 
and some of them were well versed in medicine. They attracted to their 
capitals the best Hakims from the various parts of the Islamic dominions 
and reputed Vaids from different parts of India, paid them high salaries 
and conferred upon them high titles and also occasionally gave them large 
monetary grants and landed properties. They founded numerous free 
hospitals in various parts of the country and collected large libraries and 
persuaded the Hakims to develop and improve the healing art. 

During the reign of ‘Alauddin Khalji, there were numerous reputed 
Hakims and Vaids in Delhi whose names are mentioned by Barani. 
Muhammad b. Tughlaq was well versed in Unani Tibb and personally 
examined and treated the patients, and discussed medical problems with 
the Hakims. At his persuasion Hakim Diya Muhammad, the son of 
Muhammad Masud, compiled in a.d. 1320 a book, Majmuai-Diyaiyya^ 
on the basis of Arabic, Persian and also some Ayurvedic medical works. 
In this book there is reference to another book, Majmuai-Shamaiyya, 
which was compiled earlier by Shamsuddin Mustaufi, which is said to be a 
Persian translation of an Ayurvedic book.® Firoz Shah Tughlaq had 
a thorough knowledge of Unani Tibb. He had dictated a book, Tibbe- 
Firoz shahU on the subject and personally attended to the patients in a large 
free hospital founded by himself. He was a good bone-setter and was 
specially interested in opthalmology. Mian Bhowa, the Lord Chamberlain 
of Sikandar Lodi, collected together numerous competent Hakims and 
Vaids and got compiled by them, an Indian treatise of medicine, on the 
basis of a dozen of important Ayurvedic works. This book is known as 
Ma*danush-ShifdhSikandari. Mian Jaha, another Amir of Sikandar Lodi, 
according to a contemporary historian, was well versed not only in Islamic 
literature and Indian music and arts and crafts, but also in Indian system 
of medicine. He remembered by heart twenty-four thousand verses on 
Indian medicine; and Hindu experts in Indian medicine and music took 
lessons from him in these subjects.^ 

The provincial Muslim rulers of the various parts of India followed 
the footsteps of the Sultans of Delhi and encouraged their court physicians 
to develop medical literature. Thus, during the reign of Muzaffar Shah 
of Gujarat (a.d. 1396-1410), Hakim Shahabuddin compiled two books on 
medicine: (1) TibbUShifauUKhani in Persian prose and (2) Tibbe-Shihabi 


• HamdardU^ihhat, pp. 4-9. 


* Siddiqi, pp. xxxii S.

in Persian poetry. He compiled these books on the basis of Arabic, Persian 
and some Ayurvedic works and took help in this connection from some 
Yogis, He has mentioned in the book the names of certain drugs in Sanskrit 
as well as in Sindhi. After him Hakim ‘Ali Muhammad, the court physician 
of Mahmud Shah (a.d. 1458-1510),^ translated at his command, with 
the help of some Pundits, a book of Vagbhata from Sanskrit into Persian.*' 

In the Deccan under the Bahmanid ruler, Mahmud Shah (a.d. 1378- 
1396), translated certain Ayurvedic works into Persian, in three volumes. 
It was named Tibhe-Shifai-Mahmudi.^ Under the ‘Adil-Shahi dynasty 
of Bijapur, Hakim Muhammad Qasim Hindu Shah, generally known as 
Firishta, wrote in the year a.d. 1590 a book, Dasturil-Atbba, which is also 
called Ikhtiyarati-Qasimi. In the introduction to this book, he says that 
at first he made a deep study of the Tibbe-Unani and after that he studied 
Ayurvedic system of medicine also, and found its theories as well as its 
practice well founded though at the outset they appeared to be strange. 
He adds that he was also closely associated with some of the Vaids. To 
several of them he was referred by name.'* Alauddin Ahmad Shah II of 
Bahmani dynasty founded a large free hospital at Bidar, appointed Hakims 
as well as Vaids in it to attend to the patients. He also established a medical 
school which was attached to the hospital. In his court there were numerous 
Hakims and Vaids, some of whom* compiled some important medical 
books. As a matter of fact, since the advent of the Muslims, the Deccan 
has ever been one of the important centres of the Unani Tibb. 

Like Gujarat and the Deccan, the rulers of each of the local Indian 
Muslim State had in their courts several Hakims and Vaids, some of whom 
made their own contributions to the development of the Unani Tibbi 
literature in India. 

The advent of the Mughals added largely to the popularity, progress 
and glory of Unani Tibb in India. They gave the Hakims much higher 
position and paid them much higher salaries, giving some of them Rs. 50,000 
per annum, and occasionally bestowed upon them much higher rewards 
in cash and in kind that did their predecessors. Thus they attracted to 
India many more highly qualified Hakims from Iran and other places than 
their predecessors could, and encouraged them to cultivate and advance 
the Tibbi-Unani in this country. They also established a network of many 
new free public hospitals in all the large cities of the country.-^ 

These hospitals must have been organized according to the same 
principles as those of the other Islamic dominions which, according to 
Cyril Elgood,^' were as models of the European hospitals. But in the 
medieval Indian hospitals generally the Hakims and the Vaids worked 
side by side as it is obvious from the description of the hospital which was 
founded by a Khayr Andish Khan given in his Khayrut-Tajarib,^

Abul-Fazl has given the names of 39 Hakims of his time in his *Ain. 
But they were only those who were in the service of the court at Delhi. 
In the whole country the number of the Hakims who either served in the 
various hospitals or carried on private practice in the various parts of 
India, during the Mughal rule, must have been several thousands. The 
main centres of their medical activities were Lahore, Delhi, Lucknow, Patna 
Murshidabad, Hyderabad, Madras and other important towns. In many 
of these centres there were not only well-equipped Unani hospitals, but 
also Tibh Mdeirasas. 

These Hakims made large contributions to the so-called Tibbi-UnanL 
A large part of this literature consisted of the translation, commentaries 
or summaries of Arabic medical books, or of the translation or adaptation 
of Ayurvedic works. And some of them are based on any one or both of 
them. The Tibbi-Aurangzebi, which was dedicated to Aurangzeb, is entirely 
based on Ayurvedic sources. The MuUmlajdti-Darshikohi of Nuruddin 
Muhammad, which was dedicated to Darasdhikoh, is based mainly on 
the Greek system, but contains at the end almost the whole of Ayurvedic 
materia medica. 

But it would be a mistake to suppose that the Indian Hakims made no 
independent contribution to the so-called Tibbi-UnanL The author of 
the KhulastiCt-Tajdrib, after summarizing the Greek theories mainly 
according to Avicenna, described a large number of diseases and their 
treatment, gave clinical description of many cases and mentioned the medica- 
ments according to the Greek as well as the Ayurvedic system. He laid 
it down that in the science of medicine experience is the basic principle 
of treatment. He described several diseases including whooping cough 
which were not recognized in Europe for centuries after him. He has 
referred to Greek authors but very seldom to Ayurvedic works. Hakim 
Sharif Khan (a.d. 1725-1806) in his Tdlifi-Sharifi collected together the names 
of such Indian drugs as he had tried and found useful. In his Tuhfa-Alam 
Shdhi he has discussed the properties of various Indian diets and has remarked 
that a patient may be easily cured by the use of proper diets only. 

As a matter of fact, Hakims of the various parts of India, during the 
different periods, produced a large number of books on the various 
branches of medical science on the basis of Unani or Ayurvedic system of 
medicine and on the basis of their own experience of medical cases. 

The last large and more or less exhaustive book, the Iksiri-A*?am, 
on the various diseases from head to foot, their causes, their diagnosis and 
their treatment according to the Greek system, was compiled by Hakim 
Muhammad A‘zam Khan, in four big volumes on the basis of most of the 
important medical works on the Unani Tibb in Arabic or Persian, written 
in or outside India. The book, in spite of its large size, has already under- 
gone four editions. 

The author has never referred to any Ayurvedic work. But he has 
often mentioned the Indian medicaments after dealing with the treatment 
of the various diseases. He also compiled another large book, The Mufufi 



MEDICINE 


273 


A'^am, on materia medica, on the basis of 68 previous works on the subject. 
In it, he has mentioned a large niunber of Indian medicaments belonging 
to vegetable, mineral and animal kingdoms. These books contain the 
summary of all the previous works on these subjects. 

The Hakims generally thought that the basic Greek theory of medicine, 
which was supported by Arabic medical writers also, was unassailable. 
But a reaction against this attitude began in the nineteenth century, due 
to the influence of modem scientific discoveries and the allopathic system 
of medicine. In a.h. 1295 (a.d. 1878), Hakim Afcjal ‘Ali of Faydabad 
wrote a book, Jami ^ush^Shifaiya, in which he strongly challenged the 
theories of the Greek system and remarked that most of it was based on 
wrong presumptions. After him, Masihu’l-Mulk Hakim Muhammad 
Ajmal Khan, a man of versatile genius, broad outlook and wide influence, 
realized the defects of the Unani system of medicine, and tried to reform 
it in every possible way. He founded the Ayurvedic and the Unani Tibbi 
College in Delhi, reformed its courses of study and established a strong 
department of research on Indian drugs. He also fought hard against 
the aggressive attitude of the Medical Council and the British Government 
against the indigenous systems of medicine. He was helped in his efforts 
by the transfer of the Education Department to Indian Ministers, who, 
after making the necessary enquiries about the popularity and the practical 
utility of these systems, decided to establish official teaching institutions and 
hospitals for them. Thus were established, in addition to the already existing 
public Tibbi teaching institutions, official Tibbi colleges also at various 
places. 

The institution for research in Unani Tibbi, founded by Hakim Ajmal 
Khan, came to an end after his death. But its noble object was taken 
up by the Hamdard Dawakhana of Hakim Abdu’l-Hamid of Delhi, who 
established the Institute of History of Medicine and Medical Research with 
a hospital, a herbarium, medical library and a well-staffed department 
to do research according to modem scientific system, on the history of 
medicine in general and on the Unani Tibbi medicaments in particular, 
and endowed upon it a very large part of the income of the Hamdard 
Dawakhana. 

The Indian Hakims, however, made a large contribution to Persian 
medical hterature, discovered new diseases and their treatments, developed 
the treatment of the veneral diseases and made fresh contribution to epi- 
demiology, toxicology, therapeutics and Unani Materia Medica, They 
served sincerely the ailing Indians, the rich as well as the poor, during 
the last 800 years. And they are holding high the flag of Unani Tibb in 
India at present also.

Kaviraj Bagala Kumar Majumdar who rendered valuable assistance in the preparation

5 CHEMICAL PRACTICES AND ALCHEMY 

B. V. SUBBARAYAPPA 


Chemistry as a branch of modern science is admittedly not very old; for, 
to be precise, it became systematized only in the latter half of the eighteenth 
century a.d. mainly because of experimentation and the methodical inter- 
pretation of experimental results by Lavoiser (1743-94) and his con- 
temporaries like Joseph Black (1728-99), Henry Cavendish (1731-1810), 
Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) and Carl Wilhelm Scheele (1742-86). As a 
candid recognition of our indebtedness to the past, it must be said that 
chemical practices have been very ancient, and they formed an integral 
part of the technical skills of antiquity. The practical chemists—potters, 
brewers, dyers, metalsmiths, glassmakers and the like — contributed a great 
deal to the growth of technology and in no small measure to the economic 
welfare of the ancient communities. They were noted for their craftsman- 
ship and experimental skills involving many a chemical transformation both 
qualitative and quantitative, even though they did not appear to have 
formulated any theoretical knowledge of the chemical transformations. 
For example, the beginnings of modern chemical processes, such as fermenta- 
tion, distillation, fusion and calcination, can be traced to very ancient 
times despite the fact that the scientifically valid theoretical principles 
governing them came to be understood only a century or two ago. 

Similar is the case with the use of chemicals when man became the 
food-producer, and began to lead a settled life. There is no doubt that 
as man became more and more civilized, he developed varied avenues for 
the use of a number of chemicals and, in the process, acquired considerable 
knowledge of their occurrence, preparation and properties even though that 
knowledge, in point of fact, was not deep and systematized from the point 
of view of modem chemistry. 

In India, the beginnings of chemistry as practical and purposeful art 
are noticeable in remote antiquity. Of particular importance is the knowl- 
edge as well as the technique concerning the baking of clay and production 
of pottery, i.e. of objects fashioned from clay and hardened by fire. The 
use of pottery has an added significance in the history of chemistry. For, 
besides satisfying the potter’s urge to create forms and paint artistically on 



CHEMICAL PRACnCES AND ALCHEMY 


275 


them, the use of pottery enabled the ancient practical chemists to develop 
processes involving prolonged heating, fusion, evaporation and, more 
importantly, the treatment of minerals. India has been well known for a 
number of pottery types from the neolithic phase right up to the medieval 
period. Metal-working, processing of various naturally occurring minerals, 
slaking of the burnt limestone, compositions of mortar and cement, prepa- 
ration of fermented juices, extraction of essential oils, use of pigments, 
and production of different types of glass were among the noteworthy 
chemical practices in India even in very ancient times. Though it is rather 
difficult to trace the indigenous origins of these practices, there is no doubt 
that most of them grew out of the sustained efforts and special technical 
abilities of the people of the region, and reached peaks of excellence at 
times. 


PRE-VEDIC PERIOD (FROM PREHISTORIC TIMES TO 
c. 1500 B.c.) 


Pottery 

There is evidence to indicate that in the prehistoric period the technique 
of pottery-making was known in India. It would appear that the pots were 
hand-made in that period, the potter’s wheel being unknown. There were 
also no kilns specially built for firing the pots. Heating was done by raising 
a small fire around the pots which were placed in circular pits after covering 
the pots partially with sherds. The common shapes were globular pots 
of various sizes with round bases and flaring slips. Bowls with several 
shapes of bases were also in use. Hand-made, coarse and ill-fired redware 
sherds with microliths have been found in the excavations (late levels) of 
the prehistoric rock shelters at Lekhahia (Mirzapur district in Uttar 
Pradesh), and also in Baluchistan, Mundigak, Langhnaj (north Gujarat), 
Nagarjunakonda (Andhra Pradesh) and Birbhanpur (West Bengal).® 
Hand-modelled pottery, coarse grey or black burnished and ill-fired, with 
mat-marked bases has been noticed at Burzahom (Kashmir; about ten miles 
north-east of Srinagar) in the early neolithic phase (c. 2375-1500 b.c.). 
In the southern Deccan (e.g. Brahmagiri, Sanganakallu, Utnur, Piklihal, 
Paiyampalli and T. Narasipur) hand-made grey or buff-brown pottery 
(some having black or red burnished slip) with ring feet and hollow 
pedestals, and bands of red ochre on the surface, have been found 
(c. 2300-1800 B.C.). The wheel-thrown ware also appeared soon in this 
region as evidenced by the Black-and-Red painted pottery.* 

In the history of the wheel-turned pottery, as also of other chemical 
practices in India, special significance attaches to the Indus Valley Civilization

which was by far the largest of the world*s three most ancient civilizations. 
This great civilization, now referred to as the Harappa Culture, is known to 
have flourished during the period c. 2300-1750 B.c. and its sites have been 
located in the Panjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh, north Rajasthan 
(former State of Bikaner), Kutch, Saurashtra, central and southern Gujarat, 
and Baluchistan, covering an area of roughly 840,000 square miles.® 

In the early occupations at Harappa and other regions, generally 
designated as the pre-Harappan culture (c. 2600-2400 b.c.), wheel-made pots 
with red wash and black paintings have been found, as also of polychrome 
styles. The pottery of the pre-Harappan occupation at Kalibangan, a site 
on the now dried up Ghaggar river in the district of Ganganagar in Raja- 
sthan, is light and thin in fabric, even though the sturdy fabric with incised 
designs is not wanting. The colour of this pottery is red to pinkish, painted 
in black, sometimes with white painting over half-slipped dull surface. On 
the basis of the fabric and decoration, this pottery, which presents a number 
of motifs, has been classified into six groups — labelled Fabric A to Fabric 
F.*» 

The pottery of the Harappan culture which consists of mainly wheel- 
made ware, turned in various shapes and sizes out of the well-levigated 
alluvium of the Indus, comprises the Red, Buff, Black-and-Red, Coarse Grey 
and the Micaceous Red ware with paintings in black over red.*^ The 
colour and the other characteristics of these wares depended obviously 
upon the composition of the clay used and the techniques of firing under 
either oxidizing or reducing conditions. Mica, sand and lime were used 
as tempering materials. The presence of mica in the clay generally helped 
not only in the working of the pot on the wheel but also in the process of 
drying of the pottery without cracking. The red shades which developed 
on the pottery were due to the presence of iron compounds in the clay, 
which would undergo change in colour in the course of firing as a result of 
the oxidizing atmosphere in the kiln. Not infrequently the black or choco- 
late designs painted on the body of the ware were executed using mangani- 
ferous haematite compositions. However, the exact information respecting 
the techniques employed for obtaining the distinctively coloured pottery still 
appears to be scanty. Decoration of pottery often consisted of several 
designs, geometrical, plant or animal forms fashioned normally in black 
paint. The designs included, among others, squares divided into a number 
of triangles and rectangles, wavy lines, loops, chequers, lattice work, rosettes, 
forms of peacock, flying birds, deer and fish, pipal and palm leaves, and 
occasionally human forms. The potters were indeed skilled craftsmen of 
high order as evidenced by the exquisitely executed miniature vessels. ‘The 
general impression given by the Indus pottery is that of efficient mass 
production’,** and what is remarkable is the extreme standardization of 
production.

The white ash remains of the kilns point out unmistakably that wood

crushed quartz or white sand, a glassy flux (probably obtained by fusing 
soda with sand) and, if desired, a colouring matter. An analysis of a few 
specimens of glazed pottery has revealed that the blue shades are due to 
copper oxide, the greenish blue due to iron oxide in addition, while excess 
of manganese oxide is responsible for the appearance of dark or maroon 
colour. Mackay is of the view that the glazed pottery found at Mohenjo- 
daro was probably the earliest specimen, and according to him the four 
pieces found at Mohenjo-daro are beyond all doubt the handiwork of a 
potter who was well acquainted with the process and able to carry it to a 
high degree of perfection.® It is known now that the practice of glazing the 
pottery appeared in Mesopotamia about 1,500 years later than in the 
Harappan culture. 

The terracotta craft, another aspect of pottery-making, which included 
the execution of human and animal forms, dolls and other decorative pieces, 
was in practice in the Harappan culture. The Harappan figurines, entirely 
hand-modelled, which have been unearthed speak of the achievements in 
the terracotta craft. 

A detailed enumeration of the pottery of the post-Harappan cultures 
of the north, the north-west, central and southern India is not possible in 
this short account. Suffice it to say that there was a continuity in the 
potting tradition though some of the Harappan features disappeared and 
some new decorative motifs appeared. In course of time, there came into 
use the bright red burnished ware known as the Lustrous Red ware found 
in sites in Kathiawar and western India. Black-and-Red pottery often with 
white painted geometrical designs also made its appearance. This type of 
pottery dominated in what is known as Ahar culture (also called the Banas 
culture named after the river Banas in the south-eastern Rajasthan (c. 2000^ 
1600 B.C.). Cream-slipped ware with remarkable surface paintings and 
the red-slipped ware also belong to the Banas culture. Besides, during the 
period under reference the other important pottery assemblages comprise 
the Malwa ware (Navdatoli, Prakash, Bahai, Eran, Nagda, etc.; its distri- 
bution covers the basins of Chambal, Narmada, Tapti and Godavari 
rivers) which is generally a pale-red-slipped ware decorated with designs 
painted in purplish to brown-black colour; and the Jorwe ware (Jorwe, 
Nasik, Nevasa, Daimabad, Chandoli, etc., in the northern Deccan) which has 
a well-baked core with a metallic ring and a light orange or dull-red 
matt surface having geometrical paintings in black colour.^* ® 


Metals and Metal-working 

In the field of metals, the pre-Harappan cultures are not noted for an 
extensive use of metals by them; only at a few places (Mundigak, Nal, 
Kalibangan and Mehi), there is evidence of the use of copper. But the picture

is entirely diiferent in the Harappan culture, the metal-workers of which 
undoubtedly knew the art of using copper, bronze, lead, silver, gold and 
electrum— an alloy of gold and silver. Silver might have been obtained from 
Afghanistan, Armenia and Persia, copper ore from Rajasthan and Afghani- 
stan, and lead from Ajmer area. The Harappan metalsmiths were well aware 
of the technique of making beads, soldering, sheet-making, rivetting, coiling 
and cire perdue casting (lost-wax metal-casting process, the details of which 
are given elsewhere in this chapter). Gold was used principally for making 
ornaments (beads, pendants, armlets, brooches, etc.) and silver for orna- 
ments, vessels and the seals. ‘Much of the Indus gold is of light colour, 
indicating a high silver content, or rather that it is unrefined “ electrum 
This suggests that it originated from the reefs of Mysore rather than from 
panning, and the possibility is certainly not discouraged by the numbers of 
neolithic settlements which are reported from Mysore, particularly cluster- 
ing around the Hatti gold bands.’ Copper sheets were shaped into 
vessels, and bronze was used for casting purposes by the cire perdue process. 
It is generally believed that the small bronze statuette of the ‘ dancing girl ’ 
discovered at Mohenjo-daro was fashioned by casting, probably by the 
lost-wax process, although there is no direct evidence to this effect as yet.® 
Moulds for casting bronze have not been found yet in the excavations 
at Mohenjo-daro. This bronze statuette seems to represent the first 
appearance of the figure in the metal-art of India. 

The specimens unearthed at Mohenjo-daro, of copper-bronze imple- 
ments or tools and weapons of warfare include axes, daggers, knives, spears, 
arrow-heads, short swords, chisels, drills, reamers, fish-hooks and metal 
mirrors. About 70 per cent of the tools excavated are found to be un- 
alloyed as they have in them about one per cent of tin only, while only 
14 per cent of them are alloyed correctly (8-12% tin). It would thus 
appear that the Harappan metalsmiths were not able to maintain the correct 
proportions of tin while alloying and producing implements on a large scale.^* 
A remarkable metallic tool, though rare, of Harappan culture is the true saw 
which has the teeth and the adjoining part of the blade set alternatively from 
side to side. It would seem that this type of arrangement in a saw was 
unknown elsewhere until the Roman times. According to Mackay, no 
metal arrow-heads of the type found at Mohenjo-daro have as yet appeared 
in Egypt, nor in any Sumerian or Elamite sites. Identical arrow-heads, 
however, were in use at Minoan and Mycenean sites at a later date.®

Though copper and bronze were in common use, there are indications 
that an alloy of copper and arsenic (3-4-5%) was also used in the place of 
low grade bronze. The Harappan metalsmiths appeared to have a sound 
knowledge of cold-working and the annealing of metal. Evidently they 
used crude copper (with considerable sulphur content) for casting plain 
objects, and refined copper for shaping it into the desired types of vessels. 
Possibly the vessels were shaped, raised or sunken by hammering. Not un- 
often open moulds were used for casting purposes. A number of bun-shaped 
ingots and castings have been found on the sites of Mohenjo-daro and 
Lothal, and it is not unlikely that the copper ingots (99*46-99-8% pure) 
which have been found at the latter site were imported from outside, possibly 
from Mesopotamia. Obviously, smelting operations utilizing the ores were 
carried out in the neighbourhood of mines and, as Mackay says, the rough 
‘metals’ were transported and made available to the workers for refining and 
subsequent workings. Though the kilns used for these purposes have yet to 
be found, Mackay® is of the opinion that the ore (possibly with alternate 
layers of charcoal) was smelted in an open hearth, using charcoal as fuel over 
a cavity in the ground so that the molten metal would run into the cavity. 
There is no denying the fact that, in comparison with the other chalcolithic 
cultures at Ahar, Navdatoli, Chandoh, Nevasa, Jorwe, etc., where a 
number of copper objects like chisels, bangles and fish-hooks have been 
found, the Harappan culture was far advanced in the technique of metal- 
working. This was probably due to the special attention bestowed on 
the durability, utility and elegance of the metallic tools and implements. 
However, a fact of special significance is that the metallurgy of iron was 
unknown to the Harappan metal-workers. 

While considering the metal-working and metallurgical practices in 
the pre-Vedic period, a reference to what is termed as ‘ copper-hoards * is 
necessary. These copper artifacts, about a thousand in number and many 
of them found in hoards (hence the name), have been reported from some 
34 sites in Uttar Pradesh, Central India, Bihar, Bengal, Orissa and Andhra 
Pradesh. The types of copper-hoards include flat axes, shouldered axes, 
bar-celts, or chisels, harpoon-heads, spearheads, rings, antennae swords 
and anthropomorphic objects.^ The tools, which might have been fashioned 
by closed casting, are largely of copper and hence the knowledge of alloying 
might have been unknown to their makers who were probably semi-nomadic 
metalsmiths. Although the chronological problem relating to the copper- 
hoards has not been solved satisfactorily yet, their probable date may 
be c. 1700-1000 B.c. There is a view associating the copper-hoards with 
some pre-Aryan tribal people who inhabited the Ganga basin.®* ^ A striking 
feature of the problem of these hoards is that none of them has been 
found in stratified deposits, nor has any pottery been found so far in direct 
association with them, although the Ochre-Coloured ware has been noticed

Other Chemical Practices 

Extensive archaeological excavations in different sites of the Indus 
valley have brought to light more details relating to the chemical knowledge 
and technological practices as far back as about 4,500 years. It 
would appear that both gypsum and lime were used as plaster materials 
at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa. Chemical analyses of the samples collected 
from different places at Mohenjo-daro indicate that mortars were generally 
made of gypsum, lime and sand. Burnt brick (well-cut, colour ranging 
from that of straw to bright red) made from ordinary alluvial soil found 
use in the extensive construction of walls, bathing-pools, drains, wells, etc. 

The remains unearthed at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa reveal that the 
people of the Indus valley were using a variety of minerals for ornamental,

cosmetic and medicinal purposes. Lapis lazuli (beautiful blue stone, princi- 
pally silicate, stained deep blue by the presence of other minerals), turquoise 
(hydrous phosphates of aluminium and copper ujed as a gem), alabaster 
(pleasing form of stained gypsum or hydrated calcium sulphate used for 
ornamentation), haematite (ferric oxide), jasper (impure opaque silica), 
amethyst (either quartz or aluminium oxide used as a semi-precious stone) 
and agate (crystalline coloured variety of silica) are among a number of 
mineral objects found in different sites of the Harappan culture. Obviously, 
the Harappan artisans must have had an intimate knowledge of the processing 
and properties of these naturally occurring chemical substances. A close 
examination of the finds indicates that the Harappan craftsmen had de- 
veloped to a high degree the art of shaping as well as polishing the precious 
and semi-precious stones which were used generally for the production of 
beads with great dexterity. 

While the remarkable achievements of the Harappan people in the 
practical chemical arts of pottery, metal-working, use of minerals and the 
like have come to light, there is little or no information about the specula- 
tions or conceptual frame of the people relating to their achievements. Even 
not much is known of the people of this great civilization. The Harappans 
had developed a script which has been characterized partially as ‘ picto- 
graphic’.® So far about 400 distinct signs have been observed and the 
script is not found to be alphabetic. The letters on the inscribed sherds 
found at Kalibangan indicate that the direction of writing was from right 
to left. The script has yet to be deciphered on a rational basis, and only 
its decipherment would throw light on the thoughts and practices of the 
Indus valley people; it may also unfold the origin and evolution of these 
people in a way more authentic than what is presently known. 


THE VEDIC AGE 

In the next phase of the early Indian cultural history (c. 1500-600 b.c.) 
we have to consider the chemical knowledge and practices of a new set of 
people with a new social order, often referred to as the Indo-Aryans who are 
believed to have settled first in north-western India and gradually extended 
their settlements over the whole of north India. The probable date 
of this presumed Indo-Aryan cultural settlement has not been settled yet 
beyond doubt. Till recently, the chronological range of the Harappan 
culture was recognized to be c. 2500-1500 b.c., while the radiocarbon 
analysis* of the charcoal remains of this culture-area, points to a date 

® Majumdar (R. C.), I, p. 181. 

* Carbon-14 (C“) is a radioactive isotope of carbon (or radiocarbon) with an atomic 
weight of 14, the normal atomic weight of carbon being 12. The radiocarbon is 
being produced in nature as a result of the interaction of the fast-moving neutrons 
(which are themselves produced from primary cosmic rays on entering the earth’s 
atmosphere) on atoms of the air. The radiocarbon combines with oxygen forming

A CONCISE fflSTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


range of c. 2300-1750 b.c.® Again the radiocarbon-dating methods have 
indicated that the distinctive type of potteiy known as the Painted Grey 
ware, which is believed generally to have been used by the Indo-Aryans, 
might have been evolved by them around c. 1000-800 b.c. The old con- 
ception that the Aryans might have destroyed the Harappans is gradually 
losing ground as a result of recent studies; instead, the possibility of flood 
as also the shifting of courses of ancient rivers, annihilating the flourishing 
Harappan civilization is increasingly acquiring credence. 

Whatever may be the Aryan problem in India—and a discussion on 
this is beyond the scope of the present account— it would seem that the 
Aryans, in course of time, might have mixed with the non-Aryans or the 
early inhabitants, assimilating or giving a new dimension to the cultural, 
conceptual as well as utilitarian practices of the latter. They followed the 
sacred hymns, rituals and thoughts which went under the names of the 
Vedas, the Brahmanas, the Aranyakas and the Upani^ods, some of which 
give a glimpse of a few chemical practices prevalent then. 

The Bgveda Samhitd, the earliest literary composition of this period, 
mentions the use of metals including gold.** Even though in this text there 
does not seem to be any plausible account of the metallurgical practices 
followed by the people of that time, possibly the ore was smelted in small 
furnaces. The general terra used for the metal is ayas which might have 
meant copper, bronze or lead. There is no doubt that later the word 
ayas began to mean iron.® The Vedic people believed that gold possessed 

gaseous carbondioxide (C^* 02 ) and the latter gets into the vegetation as a result of 
plant metabolism and also into the animals which feed on vegetation. 

When carbon-14 disintegrates, nitrogen is formed and beta particle is emitted. In 
5570 ±40 years, known as the half-life period of carbon-14, half of a given number of 
atoms of the radiocarbon undergoes radioactive decay and, with the lapse of time, the 
radioactivity goes on decreasing. It has been calculated that in about 70,000 years, 
practically all its radioactivity will be lost. The quantity of radiocarbon in contemporary 
materials is too small and far below the sensitivity limit of an isotope-measurement device 
such as the mass spectrograph. However, its radioactivity can be measured and, by 
comparing the radioactivity of a particular carbon remnant (like plant remains, 
charcoal, marine shells and carbonate deposits) with that of carbon of the present time, 
the time elapsed in relation to the carbon remnant can be arrived at mathematically. 

It is generally assumed that all living organisms possess the same proportion of 
carbon-1 4/carbon- 12 and that the radiocarbon disintegrates at the same rate after 
their death. These assumptions are not found to be strictly correct and hence a certain 
amount of error creeps in the reckoning of dates by the radiocarbon method. 

(For details see McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology, 1960, 
Vol. II. pp. 291-96). 

* The earliest levels of Moheqio-daro and Lothal for which no carbon-14 dates are 
available are presumed to go back to 2500-2400 b.c. (Rao, S. R., in a personal 
communication).

supernatural powers (a general belief common to all people of the 
ancient times). The Atharvaveda even speaks of gold as conferring long life 
on one who wears it.® The metal-workers of the Vedic period doubtless 
possessed the technical knowledge of using copper and bronze for the 
production of utilitarian appliances for domestic as well as ritual purposes. 

The Vedic people were well aware of the fermented drinks and the 
methods of fermentation. Soma juice,* as the divine drink of immortality, 
finds an honoured place in the Rgveda Samhita. It was obtained by 
pounding the shoots or stalk of the soma plant (Sarcostema viminalis) 
between stones (adri) to obtain the juice. The pressed juice was passed 
through a filter comprising sheep’s wool to get a clear juice which was then 
blended with milk, sour milk or barley. The exhilarating powers of the soma 
rasa, as the juice was called, have been described elaborately in the Rgveda. 
It was even called amrta (ambrosia) and, no wonder, the soma plant was 
extolled as being divine. There were also two other fermented liquors in 
use, viz. madhu (a kind of fermented liquor taken as drink during feasts) 
and sura (probably a type of beer brewed using barley grains). 

Pottery 

The Indo-Aryans, according to some scholars, seem to have developed 
and used a type of pottery now designated by the archaeologists as the 
Painted Grey ware (P.G. ware).'' A fact that merits attention is that 
P.G. ware even at its earliest occurrence in India is of a fully developed 
type. As some similar ceramic ware has been found outside India in parts of 
Greece, Iran and Siestan probably dating back to second millennium b.c., it is 
possible that the settlers on the plains of the Ganga and the Yamuna had 
a knowledge of this type of ceramic and, utilizing the then existing local 
ceramic techniques, might have developed the appropriate baking condi- 
tions for the production of the P.G. ware. This ceramic, the approximate 
date range of which is c. 1000-400 B.c., is a thin grey deluxe ware and mostly 
wheel made, well burnt, glossy and copiously painted. The decorative 
motifs on this pottery include bands, criss-cross lines, dots and dashes, 
circles and swastikas. Generally, the pottery shapes comprise carinated 
bowls, cups and dishes.'* The archaeological evidence indicates, by and 
large, an extensive western distribution of the P.G. ware (which was 
first noticed at Ahicchatra) in the valley of the Sarasvati or the modern 
Ghaggar and also the Gangetic plains. Apart from the Painted Grey 
ware some other types of pottery like Coarse-Red ware, Fire-Red ware, 
Plain-Grey ware were also in use then. Later came into use probably in

the region of modem Bihar or eastern Uttar Pradesh, what is designated as 
the Northern Black Polished ware (N.B.P. ware) to which we shall return 
later. 

Iron 

Of particular significance is the fact that a number of iron objects 
have been discovered in association with all the phases of the Painted 
Grey ware ceramic in several excavated sites. The occurrence of iron 
at the P.G. ware levels was first reported from Alamgirpur on the river 
Hindon in Meerut district. At Hastinapur® (which probably affords the 
earliest evidence of the smelting as well as the use of iron) a couple of slags 
of iron have been found in the late levels of the Painted Grey ware hori- 
zon. Among the iron objects noticed at this place are a barbed and socket- 
ed arrow-head, a chisel and a bracelet with unconnected ends. Of the 
other important sites which have yielded iron objects,^ mention may be 
made of Rupar (Panjab: nails, hooks, bars, spikes, knives, daggers, 
sickles and spearheads); Nasik (Maharashtra: leaf-shaped arrow-heads, 
caltrops, choppers, knife-blades, axes, drills, chisels, nails, ladles, etc.); 
Ujjain (Madhya Pradesh: spearheads, arrow-head, knives, crowbar 
types, spade, etc.); Nagda (Madhya Pradesh: knives, daggers, chisels, 
sickles, arrow-heads, hoes, bowls, nails, etc.); Sambhar (Rajasthan: 
double-edged daggers, sickles, crucibles, clasps, fish plates, braces, rings, 
pivots, bells, ladles, arrow-heads, spearheads, etc.); Rairh (Rajasthan: 
sword-blades, lances, spearheads, daggers, knives, sickles, adzes, door- 
fittings, etc.) and Taxila (bowl, spoons, saucepans, daggers of different 
types, an elephant goad, axe, adzes, chisel, tongs, anvils, nails, hoes, etc.). 
Further, Atranjikhera, Alamgirpur, Kausambi and Sravasti (Uttar Pradesh); 
Sisupalgarh and Jaugada (Orissa), Maheswar, Navdatoli and Tripuri 
(Madhya Pradesh); Prakash and Bahai (Maharashtra); Sonepur and Rajgir 
(Bihar); Bairat (Rajasthan); and Purana Quila (Delhi) are among the other 
sites where several iron objects have been unearthed. The date-range of 
most of these finds is 600-200 b.c., although the chronological pattern does 
not seem to be the same everywhere. It is generally believed that the iron 
objects discovered at Hastinapur, Atranjikhera, Alamgirpur, Kausambi and 
Ujjain might be earlier. A charcoal sample from an early level of Atranji- 
khera II gives a date of 1025 ±110 b.c.® On the basis of stratigraphical evi- 
dence, it would appear that the iron objects which include small fragments 
and shapeless bits might have emerged on the site at Kausambi at a period 
earlier than that of the Painted Grey ware.** But it is recognized that the 
latter itself, with its simple painted designs, belongs to a later period at 
Kausambi. The foregoing illustrates how widespread was the use of iron

even about two thousand and five hundred years back in northern as 
well as central India. 

In south India, a number of iron objects have been discovered in the 
megalithic burials, and the finds include flat axes, tanged daggers, wedge- 
shaped blades, spears, arrow-heads, horse-bits, sickles or bill-hooks, varieties 
of flanged spade, hoe and pick-axe, chisels, tripods, tridents, knives and 
saucer hook-lamps. The megalithic burials (which may also be called the 
Iron Age burials) are found distributed in most parts of peninsular India 
as well as in Khandesh and Nagpur. The probable date of the advent of 
iron in south India is supposed to be between 1050 and 950 b.c.® as indicated 
by the radiocarbon dating of the finds at Hallur in Dharwar district of 
Mysore State, i.e. nearly just at the same time in the north or perhaps a 
little earlier still, although the mode of introduction of iron into south 
India is yet to be established on sound evidence.** It is interesting to note 
that almost identical iron tool types have been found at various sites 
extending from Adichanallur in Thirunelveli district in the Madras State 
to Nagpur in the Maharashtra— places which are separated by a distance 
of almost 900 miles. 

A question that naturally arises is: from where was obtained the 
knowledge of iron-smelting by those who brought it to India? It would 
appear that the production of iron from the naturally occurring ores was 
known in the Near East, and the earliest smelting operations of iron can be 
dated as far back as the second millennium b.c. and in the region of Asia 
Minor or the Caucasus. It has been recognized that between 1800 and 
1200 B.c. the Hittitics were well known for the smelting of iron. By about 
1000 B.c. there was extensive use of iron in the Near East even though iron 
could not replace copper and bronze which had established themselves as 
metals in the service of man and which quantitatively were in greater use 
than iron. 

Presumably the Indian iron metal-workers might have become ac- 
quainted with the iron metallurgical practices of the Near East, and it might 
have taken some time for them to adapt those practices depending upon the 
availability as well as quality of the iron ore occurring in India. In course 
of time, however, they appear to have excelled themselves in the art of 
smelting and forging iron objects. It may therefore be surmized that by 
about 1000-800 b.c. the iron-smelting operations were in vogue in India and, 
in the next four to five centuries, the Indian iron and steel objects earned 
the admiration of the western world. 

Reference has already been made to the Rgvedic word ayas which 
gradually began to acquire the connotation of iron.® The process for extract- 
ing iron, as indicated in the Rgveda, has been construed to mean by some 
scholars in terms of ‘shining stones’ (ores), medicinal plants (carbonaceous

material as fuel), ‘fans of geese feather’ (bellows).® It is reasonable to 
suppose that the small furnaces employed for the extraction of iron might 
have been of an open hearth type. 

Among the earliest foreign accounts of the use of iron in India is the 
one by the Greek historian, Herodotus (fifth century b.c.), who mentions 
that the Indians in the Persian army used cane arrows tipped with iron.*^ 
Ktesias^^ speaks of two swords of Indian steel presented to him in the 
Persian Court. Later it has been recorded by Quintus Curtis'* that in the 
gifts which Alexander the Great received from Porus of Taxila (326 B.c.) 
were 100 ‘talents’ of steel. These facts illustrate beyond any doubt that 
by the fifth or fourth century B.c. the Indian metal-workers had attained 
a high degree of perfection in the techniques of producing iron and steel. 
Even in later times there is enough evidence to show that the Indian iron 
and steel had become famous, particularly in the early centuries of the 
Christian era. Pliny refers to swords of good quality made of Indian 
steel. The Romans were fascinated by the Indian steel which they imported 
to produce fancy cutleries and armours.'' 

Yet there is practically no recorded information of value to the under- 
standing as well as evaluation of the metallurgical practices of India 
in the ancient period. Obscurity hangs over the actual methods which 
were adopted by the ancient ironsmiths for winning the metal from its ores. 
The difficulty is minimized, if not completely overcome, by the reconstruc- 
tion of the remote past on the basis of some primitive methods which are 
adopted by tribal ironsmiths even now in certain parts of the country. 
There is no doubt that some of the metallic objects which have been still 
in existence withstanding the ravages of clime bear eloquent testimony to 
the ancient metallurgical practices. These will be dealt with later. 

THE POST-VEDIC PERIOD AND THE CLASSICAL AGE 

The post-Vedic period and later the Classical Age of India (c. 600 b.c.- 
A.D. 740) afford substantial evidence which testifies to the Indian chemical 
knowledge and practices of far greater import. Discernibly the chemical 
knowledge became refined and practices culminated in notable feats of 
excellence during this period. They include the production of glass and 
pottery, fermentation methods and dyeing techniques. Recent archaeo- 
logical evidence sheds fresh light on the new achievements in glass and cera- 
mic ware as well as metallurgical operation. There are a number of literary 
sources belonging to this period giving information of value on various 
chemical practices. Of them, particular mention may be made of the 
Artha^astra by Kaulilya, the two Ayurvedic classics, the Car aka and the 
Suiruta Samhitds (original compositions may belong to the early centuries 
before the Christian era though the extant ones are later), and the

Brhatsamhitd by Varahamihira. What follows is but a brief account, based 
on the archaeological and literary evidence, of some of the well-known 
chemical practices. 

Glass 

The term glass covers a wide range of substances which may differ in 
chemical composition and some physical properties but which possess the 
essential characteristics of having cooled from a state of fusion to a solid 
state without crystallization (under-cooling). Chemically glass is regarded 
as a mixture of silicates. 

Though it is not clear when and where the invention of glass occurred 
first in the old world either in Mesopotamia or Egypt, it is now recog- 
nized that the specimens of blue glass found at Tell Asmar (in Mesopo- 
tamia) are attributable to a period c. 2700-2600 B.c. The cemeteries of 
Ur III (c. 2100 B.c.) and also at Assur under the Ziggurat (c. 1800 b.c.) in 
Mesopotamia have yielded glass beads. It would appear that not only glass 
was known in Egypt by about 2000 b.c. at the time of the XII Dynasty but 
even there were real glass factories there by about the fifteenth century b.c. at 
the time of the XVIII Dynasty in the reign of Amenhotep II (1448-1420 
B.C.). Remains of a glass house and fragments of glass in several stages 
of manufacture have been found at the city of Tell el Amarna (1450-1400 
B.c.).®' ^ 

In India the Mohenjo-daro and Harappan sites have not given clues to 
the effect that the use of glass was known there; only glazed‘s beads of 
steatite or faience have been largely found. A few early objects of glass 
in the form of beads have been noticed at Maski, a chalcolithic site in the 
southern Deccan, pointing to the fact that glass was known in India at least 
at the beginning of the first millennium B.c.® But in the succeeding centuries, 
the glass industry steadily gained momentum and began to show signs of 
technical excellence which seemed to have manifested itself to a remarkable 
degree in the early centuries of the Christian era, as evidenced by the 
archaeological finds in over 30 sites. The glass objects (beads, bangles, 
ear-reels, eye-beads, etc.) unearthed at these sites are in various colours 
such as blue, green, red, white, yellow, orange and purple. In a few 
places some tiles and broken parts of vessels have also been found. 

Of the most important sites, mention may be made here of Hastinapur, 
Taxila, Ujjain, Maheswar, Nasik, Bhita, Ahicchatra, Kopia, Nalanda, 
Nevasa, Ter, Kolhapur, Kondapur, Prakash, Brahmagiri and Arikamedu.*'

Gto and glaze, though produced and used differently, are similar from the chemical 
point of view in the sense they contain soda or some other alkali as a constituent. 
Gla^ is applied generally to the base of some other material. Both glaze and glass 
are isotropic, e.g., they do not change the colour of light when tested in a polariscope.

A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDU 


At Hastinapur® have been found beads of black and brownish colour 
(hardness: 5-6; sp. gr.: 2*55; probably belonging to c. 800 b.c.). They 
are mainly of soda-limc-silicate composition with traces of phosphates 
and potassium, and their colour is due to the varying amounts of iron 
compounds in them. At Taxila,^ the Bhir Mound has yielded at the sixth- 
fourth centuries b.c. levels a number of glass beads of several shapes and 
colours (blue, green, red, orange, amber and black), ear-reel (dark green) with 
a floral design on it, ‘eye-beads’, glass bangles and seal. As one of the 
outposts of the north-western frontier of the Mauryan Empire then, Taxila 
was prone to receive and assimilate foreign influences in the technique of 
glass production. That this was so has been illustrated amply by the glass 
objects found later (first century B.c.-first century a.d.) at the new city of 
Sirkap at Taxila. The foreign glass found at this place has been recognized 
as lace glass, ribbed ware, swirled glass, blue and white cameo, mosaic and 
millefiori glass.® The last, it may be noted, which is known for its floral and 
cellular structure, was commonly produced by the Roman glass techno- 
logists, particularly those at Venice. Three glass flasks (sea- and jade-green 
in colour) and an upper portion of a glass bottle which have been found at 
Sirkap seem to be Mediterranean in origin, while the glass objects of local 
manufacture comprise sealings, beads of composite glass, rings, intaglios, 
discs, lense-like objects and large tiles. Certain specimens'^ from Taxila 
have been analysed chemically and, as a result, it has been noticed that the 
red opaque glass and strips of haematinum contain a very large percentage 
of lead, while the white opaque and the turquoise blue samples have signi- 
ficant amounts of antimony. The green-blue tiles have a high percentage 
of silica which confers on them the necessary hardness, and also an appreci- 
able percentage of potash which gives them the desired durability. 

Excavations at Ujjain® have brought to light some beads, ear-reels and 
bangles in stratum II (c. 500-200 b.c.), and those at Maheswar,-^ an annealed 
black glass seal which depicts an elephant in a lively posture (c. 400 b.c.) 
and ear-reels of amber colour. At Nasik*^ have been found ear-reels 
(c. 200 B.C.), gold-foil beads and rings. Bhita and Ahicchatra are the other 
places where gold-foil beads have also been found along with a number 
of beads of different colours. Particular mention should be made of the 
fact that some sites like Kaundinyapura, Ahicchatra, Ujjain, Sravasti and 
Sirkap have also yielded what are known as ‘stratified eye-beads’,* the 
technical know-how of which seems to have been borrowed from outside. 

A large number of glass objects which seem to be indicative of the 
remains of an ancient glass factory (c. third century B.c.-third century a.d.) 
have been observed at Kopia^ on the bank of the river Anoma in the Basti 
district of Uttar Pradesh, They are generally of soda-lime glass (sp. gr. :

In the site at Nevasa have been observed beads of different colours 
including the gold-foil ones as well as small glass vessels in green and blue 
colours. At Ter have been found beads, finger-ring and a flask of agate- 
banded type which seems to be of Mediterranean origin. From the exca- 
vations at Brahmapuri on the outskirts of the city of Kolhapur have been 
reported a number of oblate beads of green, blue and yellow colour, and 
from Kondapur, beads of blue or blue-green glass with copper or cobalt as 
the colouring agent. The finds at Prakash include opaque as well as 
polychrome glass bangles and beads.® 

Brahmagiri** in the southern Deccan has yielded a number of glass 
bangles, some of which are black while the others have yellow strips over a 
grey-coloured base (first-fourth centuries a.d.). At Arikamedu,^^ an early 
historical site on the eastern coast south of Madras, have been noticed a 
number of glass objects both locally produced and imported. The former 
comprises a number of beads in blue, green and copper-red colour. Of the 
latter, the noteworthy are the fragments of glass bracelets, beads (sp. gr.: 
2*51-2-91; hardness: 5.7) and bowl of whitish iridescent glass and a bluish 
glass bowl full of bubbles and striae which indicate their Roman origin. 
It may be noted that there was extensive commercial contact between this 
region and the Roman world in the early centuries of the Christian era. 

In the Sanskrit texts the term used for glass is kaca. Among the well- 
known literary works which contain references to kaca are Satapatha 
Brahmanay^ KautiUya Artha^Sstra,^ Caraka Samhitd/ Hitopadesa^ and 
Brhatsamhitd} Notwithstanding the fact that both the literary works 
and the archaeological finds shed light on the use of glass in India over a 
long time, the origin of glass production in India has not been established 
beyond doubt. Even so there does not seem to be any doubt that the glass 
industry in India had made headway in the first quarters of the first millen- 
nium B.C., and that the glassmakers were skilful in controlling the tem- 
perature of fusion, moulding, annealing, blotching and gold-foiling. The 
different glass objects found in some 17 sites have been analysed chemically.* 
The following tables (5. 1-5-4) give an insight into the chemical compositions 
of glass objects found at Taxila, Kopia, Nalanda and Arikamedu.

parts of north India (hence its name)® and also at some places in central 
as well as southern India. Possibly the N.B.P. ware which, as stated 
already, appeared first in the region of modern Bihar and eastern Uttar 
Pradesh might have spread in course of time to some other parts of 
northern, central and southern India. In north India, they have been found 
in large numbers in Uttar Pradesh (Ahicchatra, Mathura, Hastinapura, 
Kausambi, Sarnath, Bhita, Jhusi, Masaon, Sravasti and Atranjikhera); 
Bihar (Patna, Rajgir, Giriak and Vaisali); Rajasthan (Bairat); Madhya 
Pradesh (Sanchi, Nagda, Ujjain, Eran, Maheswar and Tripuri); Bengal 
(Bangarh and Chandraketugarh) ; Orissa (Sisupalgarh) ; Maharashtra 
(Prakash, Bahai, Nasik, Nevasa, Ter and Kaundanyapur) ; and Andhra 
Pradesh (Amaravati and Chebrolu). The probable date of the N.B.P. ware 
spread may be about the sixth century b.c. to second century b.c. 

The N.B.P. ware seems to have been made on a fast-spinning wheel, 
using fine clay and firing to a high temperature in kilns. It is possible, as

suggested by some archaeologists, that some of the N.B.P. wares were 
dressed with haematite before firing, and that the process of firing might

archaeologists have been maintaining this nomenclature. 



298 


A CX3NCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


be responsible not only for the production of colour ranging from jet black 
to glossy-grey but also metallic sound, which are the characteristics of this 
ceramic. The black colour of the ware has been attributed to the presence 
of ferrous oxide (about 13%)“ which would develop (by the action of 
reducing gases formed in the kiln) on the original hi^ly ferruginous slip 
which used to be applied to the surface of the ceramic body consisting of a 
levigated mixture of clay and red ochre. The polishing might have been 
done before or after the firing. The black polishwi film of some samples, on 
chemical analysis, has been found to contain silica 46*55 %, ferrous oxide 
25*20%, alumina 15*53%, lime 4*74% and magnesia 3*43%. The 
formation of ferrous silicate may be causative of colouring the body black; 
and it is not unlikely that the deposition of carbon in the pores of the 
pottery as a result of the smoky atmosphere of the kiln also plays its role 
in the black coloration of the pot. There are divergent views on the 
chemical aspects of the N.B.P. ware. According to the analysis of the 
archaeological chemist in India, ‘the lustre on the surface of the ware 
appears to be composed of some easily fusible material, possibly of organic 
origin, which undergoes incipient fusion at a low heat’.^ 

The chemical analysis carried out at the British Museum Laboratory 
shows that the unfired pots were dipped in a suspension of ferruginous 
inorganic material probably resembling a red earth; and that, after firing 
to a temperature of c. 800°c, the kiln was sealed so that the pots cooled 
in a reducing atmosphere. According to yet another analysis conducted 
at the Laboratory of the M.S. University of Baroda, the shining black slip 
might have been produced by an application of a carefully selected liquid 
clay, ‘peptized’ by the addition of an alkaline material (like sajji-matti, rhe 
or khariy which is available abundantly in the plains of the Ganga), which 
interacts chemically with alumina and silica of the clay. On firing, the 
ware is said to acquire the necessary strength as well as the glaze-like gloss 
on the surface.*^ 

The N.B.P. ware specimens found at Taxila, probably belonging to the 
first or second century a.d., reveal an advanced state of workmanship and 
sophistication. Well-finished ware with painted lips, handles, spouts, etc., 
have been discovered. Decorated pottery, though rare, comprises those 
having painted or neatly impressed designs which include triangles, loops, 
festoons, common flowers, cocks or peacocks. 

Ceramic ware with utilitarian devices continued to show signs of 
excellence in the Classical Age as evidenced by terracotta seals, plaques, 
figurines, bricks and tiles. Apart from the wheel-thrown pottery, the 
mould-made pots also came into use. Special types of glossy pottery too 
were produced using mica dust, besides those with graceful and appeal- 
ing designs which included among others lotuses, certain geometrical 
forms, spirals and ornate pendants. At Ahicchatra have been observed

cylindrical pits of large dimensions which possibly were the special types 
of kilns for the baking of ornamental pottery and turning of tiles. 

Metal-working 

In the working of metals too India of this period had to its credit 
spectacular achievements of excellence, particularly in the Classical Age. 
The metal-workers skilfully worked on copper, bronze, brass and iron. 
The art of jewellery using precious metals and stones was in a flourishing 
state. A significant find connected with the jewellery craft has been reported 
from Ahicchatra, A solid copper bolt (24}" in length and a circum- 
ference of 14" at the centre and 12" at the ends), found in the Rampurva 
Asoka Pillar near Nepal border, reveals an advanced workmanship.® 

In the Classical Age, there were centres well known for the metal 
industry. Vatsyayana in his Kamasutra includes dhdtuvada (metal-working) 
in the list of 64 kalds. The Chinese piligrim, Hiuen Tsang, has given a 
description of how brass was being extensively used in India at the time 
of his visit, and spoken of a huge copper image of the Buddha (80 ft. in 
height) and a brass temple being built (height expected to reach 100 ft. or 
more) by Harsha.* 

A remarkable sculpture of the Classical Age, which sheds light on the 
copper metal-working of the time, is the huge statue of the Buddha (7 ft. 
6 in. in height and nearly a ton in weight), probably belonging to the 
fifth century a.d. Discovered in the ruins of a Buddhist monastery at 
Sultanganj (in Bihar) by an engineer of the East India Company in 1864 
and now housed in the Museum and Art Gallery of Birnaingham, this huge 
statue appears to have been cast in two layers, the outer layer by the cire 
perdue technique. The inner layer seems to have been cast in segments on 
a mould composed of sand, clay, charcoal and paddy husks, using iron 
bands for holding the segments together.® Some Sanskrit texts of this 
period, viz. Mdnasdra, Silparatna and Vismdharmottara, give an account 
of the cire perdue process. 

Another historic vestige which gives an insight into the admirably 
qualitative as well as quantitative workmanship of the artisans of the 
Classical Age is the famous Iron Pillar now located in Meharauli (Delhi) 
near Qutub Minar.** It has a height of 24 ft. 3 in. (with 1 ft. 8 in. below 
ground); its diameter diminishes from 164' below to 12-05" above. The 
specific gravity of the metal is over 7-5 and the pillar weighs more than 
six tons. Essentially made of wrought iron, its chemical composition is: 
iron 99*72%, carbon 0*08%, silicon 0*046%, sulphur 0 006%, phos- 
phorus 0*114% and manganese nil. ‘It is not many years since the 
production of such a pillar would have been an impossibility in the largest 
foundries of the world, and even now there are comparatively few places

where a similar mass of metal could be turned out.*® The probable date of 
this pillar is about a.d. 400, and since then it has been existing without any 
rust or signs of decay. The reason for this may be that a thin protective 
film of magnetic oxide (FC3O4) might have been formed on the surface as a 
result of treatments given to the surface of the pillar, such as painting with 
a mixture of different salts, heating and quenching. It is very likely that the 
rather high phosphorus and the negligible sulphur or manganese content 
might be the factors causative of the high corrosion resistance of the pillar. 
In addition to this famed pillar of iron, a colossal iron pillar of bigger 
dimensions in two pieces and of a later date (about twelfth century a.d.) 
has been found at Dhar in the Malwa region as will be seen later. These 
examples illustrate that copper and iron metallurgical practices touched 
new heights during this period. 

Copper Metallurgy 


There has been some recent evidence which gives a glimpse of the 
possible techniques employed by the early metal-workers for extracting 
copper from its ores. Obviously the process of winning the metal from

century has been described as follows.^ The ore is crushed to a powder on 
an anvil of stone with a hammer. It is then mixed with cow-dung, made into

balls and roasted. The charge consists of roasted ore, charcoal and 

iron slag, the last acting as flux smelted for 9-10 hours in a blast furnace 
made of clay and sand. The slag is first drawn off and the smelted copper 
which would accumulate at the bottom of the furnace is removed the follow- 
ing day. The mass is again melted, refined in an open furnace using a strong 
blast from below, and finally cast into bars. By this method the yield of 
the metal is said to be 2i-7i%. It is very likely that, in ancient times also, 
a process not altogether different from the above was employed for the 
extraction of copper from its ores. 

Iron Metallurgy 

Recent archaeological excavations, especially at Ujjain, have given 
some clues to the ancient practices concerning iron metallurgy. Probably 
the smelting operations consisted in heating alternate layers of the ore and 
charcoal. There is evidence to indicate that calcium compounds were

also used in the metallurgical operation possibly as a flux. The charge 
might have been enclosed with a thick coating of clay so as to form a sort 
of kiln with passages for blowing in air from below, escape of gases from 
above and flow of molten mass from the bottom. The molten mass, after

cooling, might have been subjected to hammering to drive in carbon and 
eliminate the slag. The remains of a forge, including the anvil and some 
iron implements, have also been found in this region.® 

Even now in Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra, the primitive 
methods of smelting the iron ore and forging are in vogue, practised by the 
Agarias and Khuntia Chokhs, Marias and Murias (the tribals of Madhya 
Pradesh), Sirs, Birjhia, Agaria Asurs, etc. (of Bihar), Gonds, Telis and 
Mannewars (of Maharashtra). The smelting operations are conducted 
generally in a vertical or slightly tilted cylindrical shaft made of clay about 
3 ft. high and 3-8 ft. wide. ‘The shaft tapers to the top and has three 
openings, a large one at the top, and two (one large and the other small) at the 
base. The opening at the top is for the introduction of charcoal and 
iron ores. Often a bamboo platform, called the machan, resting on poles and 
plastered with clay is erected on level with a top of the furnace. This 
platform is also provided with 3 in. dwarf walls as protective parapets and 
is sloped towards the opening of the furnace for sliding into it charcoal 
and iron ore, thus acting as an open hopper. The openings of the bottom 
are for maintaining the blast and for receiving the bloom and slag 
respectively. The aperture for receiving the bloom is significantly called 
the hagan or loha hagora (aperture for excretion). The wrought iron 
obtained by hammering the bloom is in the form of lumps or cakes. 
Bellows are employed for maintaining the flow of air to keep the furnance 
alive.’ ^ 

Slight variations have been noticed in different regions in the matter 
of using the flux and the type of furnace. While the Agarias do not use any 
flux, the smelters in Naziri Hills (North-West Frontier Provinces) 
first roast the ore and use limestone in the form of coral reefs as flux. In 
the Kathiawar area the furnances are rectangular in cross-section and 
oblong on plan. 

In south India, the furnaces appeared to be circular on plan and 
conical in shape. Even as late as in the nineteenth century a.d.,^ it was 
noticed that small furnaces made of red-potter’s clay mixed with sand were 
being used in large numbers by the ironsmiths (in the Salem region) for 
the production of bar iron. The height of the conically shaped furnaces 
(diagrammatically shown in figure) was slightly under four feet, the diameter 
shaping from thirteen inches from below to seven inches at top. The charge, 
which consisted principally of the common magnetic iron ore and the 
requisite quantity of charcoal, was introduced from the top. There were 
two openings at the bottom; one for letting in the blast and the other for 
taking out the slag. Bellows of goatskin supplied the blast for heating. 
In about two and half hours the operation would be over yielding lumps of 
about 50 per cent iron. The lumps, on forging, gave the bar iron of high 
quality containing a considerable proportion of steel. It is on record that,

as regards their quality, the worst of them was as good as the best English 
iron. The price was still less than that of the market price of the cheapest 
English bar iron then sold in India. Indian iron was preferred by the British

for producing steel of good quality. It is very likely that the crude smelting 
furnances of the tribals are, probably to a great extent, the direct 
descendants of the ancient methods of iron manufacture in India.** 

Literary Evidence 

As stated earlier, some literary works belonging to this period throw 
ample light on the chemical practices which were flourishing then. Kau- 
tilya’s ArthaMstra^ is indeed a mine of information from the point of view of 
the history of chemical practices in India. Even though the text does not

contain accounts of analysis which would bear scrutiny from the point of view 
of modern chemical analysis, the observational approach and also the 
methods of purification, as recorded in the text, are worth noting. There is 
in this text a section on the examination of precious articles to be received 
into the treasury. Details are given of the characteristics of pearls and pearl 
strings, ruby, beryl and other precious substances. ‘Hexagonal, square or 
round, of pleasant colour, having a suitable form, clear, smooth, heavy 
and lustrous’ are the characteristics of gems while ‘dull colour, with grains, 
with a hole in the bottom, broken, badly bored (and) covered with scratches’ 
are their blemishes as stated in this section. 

In the Arthasdstra, the section on mines and factories deals elaborately 
with the occurrence and nature of the ores of gold, silver, copper, lead, tin 
and iron. It is stated that in the case of all ores, when there is increase in 
heaviness there is increase in metal content. ‘Ore from rocks or a region 
of the earth, which is heavy, unctuous and soft (and which is) tawny, green, 
reddish or red (in colour) is copper ore.’ Lead ore is ‘crow-black or of 
the colour of the dove or yellow pigment or studded with white lines (and) 
smelling like raw flesh’. Iron ore is ‘grey like saline earth or of the colour 
of a baked lump of earth*. Obviously, the physical characteristics of the 
ores were well known. The director of mines was expected to be an 
expert in the science of metallic veins, exploration of ores, metallurgy and 
the art of colouring gems. Among the duties of the director of mines 
was that he should ‘establish factories for copper, lead, tin, vaikrdnta, 
brass, steel, bronze, bell metal and iron, and also (establish) trade in metal 
ware’. Factories and commerce relating to conch-shells, diamonds, gems, 
pearls, corals and caustics were also contemplated. 

The text also describes in detail the qualities of gold and silver. Gold 
which is of the colour of ‘lotus filament, soft, lustrous and not producing 
any type of sound’ is stated to be the best, the reddish yellow-coloured 
metal of middle quality, and the red-coloured one, of the lowest quality’. 
If the gold produced from the mines becomes brittle when admixed with 
lead, it is to be turned into leaves by heating and pounding on wooden 
anvils. Alternatively it could be processed by infusion with the pulp of the 
bulbous roots of kadall {Musa sapientum) and vajrd {Euphorbia antiquorum). 
As regards silver, the text says: ‘that which is white, smooth or soft is the 
best and the impure silver should be purified with one-fourth part of lead, 
and (on purification) that in which a crest has appeared at the top, which 
is clear, lustrous and of the colour of the curd is pure’. 

The artisans of Kautilya’s time must have been not only skilled in 
setting {ksepana), stringing {guna) and making solid or hollow articles of 
gold but also in the art of mixing the metals in the molten state in correct 
proportions. In the work of setting jewels in gold, the artisan, according 
to the text, should use five parts of pure gold, and two parts of gold alloyed 
with four parts of copper or silver. Silver with a quarter part copper, and 
gold with a quarter part silver were not considered to be good metals to 
work with. For the preparation of silver articles, solid or hollow silver

could be mixed with half the amount of gold. The Arthaidstra also gives 
a description of different methods employed for shaping gold and silver 
articles. As regards minting, the text says that silver coins should be made 
of four parts of copper, eleven parts of silver and one part of either iron, 
tin or lead, while copper coins could be made of four parts of silver, eleven 
parts of copper and one part of iron or any other metal. Undoubtedly, 
these compositions must have been arrived at by the technicians after a good 
deal of experimentation, though the text does not contain details in this 
respect. 

In the Arthasdstra is found an account of fermented juices. ‘Sugar- 
cane juice, jaggery, honey, treacle, the juice of jambu {Eugenia jamholana) 
and the juice of jackfruit infused with a decoction of mesasrngi {Gymnema 
sylvestra) and long pepper, kept for one month, six months or a year and 
then mixed with cidbhifa (a kind of melon), urvdruka (Cucumis usitatissimus), 
sugar-cane stalk, mango fruit and myrobalan or unmixed (with these) 
constitute the group of fermented juices.’ For purposes of fermentation 
depending upon the composition of the fermenting mixture, a ferment 
{kinva) was also employed. Such a ferment generally consisted of one 
drona of the pulp of mdsa beans {Phaseolus radiatus) raw or cooked, with 
one-third part of rice grains, morafa {Alangium salvifolium) and the like. 
The brewers of Kau^ilya’s time seem to be well versed in the preparation 
of several types of intoxicating liquors such as medaka (prepared from rice 
grains), prasanna (flour, bark and the fruits of kramuka)^ dsava (wood-apple 
fruit, treacle and honey), maireya Raggery mixed with black pepper powder 
and decoction of the bark of mesasrngi) and madhu (grape juice). Yet 
another liquor was mahdsurd which was prepared from mango juice with 
certain essences. 

The Arthasdstra gives a quantitative account of the extraction of oil. 
One-sixth is the amount of oil from linseed, one-fourth from sesame’ and 
the like. The text also has classifications such as sour fruit juices, liquids, 
spices, vegetables, etc., obviously based on their manifest chemical charac- 
teristics. 

An important aspect that should not go unnoticed from the point of 
view of the Indian alchemy is that in the Arthasdstra^ there are descriptions 
of rasapdka and rasaviddha. The word rasa has been interpreted by some 
scholars as meaning mercury, and even some attempts have been made to 
find in these descriptions the earlier chemical practices in India based on 
mercury. On a deeper analysis, it becomes indeed ^fficult to justify the 
meaning of rasa as mercury, as probably the former means the smelted 
(liquid) ore.® The origin of alchemy in India is discussed elsewhere in this 
chapter. 

Let us now turn our attention to the two medical classics. The Caraka 
Saiphitd^ gives an account of the use of several minerals, metals and metallic 
compounds, among which the following may be mentioned: adrija or

iilajatu (bitumen), mant^ura (iron rust), anjana (black sulphide of antimony), 
suvarna or kanaka (gold), ayas (iron), kdmsya (bronze or bell-metal), 
gandhaka (sulphur) and tuttha (copper sulphate). Classifying the fermented 
beverages under the title of madya varga^ Caraka describes beverages under 
the categories of madira (distilled wine), madya (fermented liquor from 
barley, etc.), mrdauka (from grape juice), rasdsava (from sugar-cane juice), 
tusdmbu (some fermented liquor from barley gruel), mddhvlka (ferments! 
liquor with honey), dsuta (brewed mixture containing soma plant juice), 
aksaki (from the chebulic myrobalan), etc. In addition are mentioned nine 
sources of fermented drinks: cereals, fruits, roots, wood, flowers, stems, 
leaves, barks and sugar; and from these as many as 84 kinds of dsava (wine) 
could be prepared according to this text. 

Kdmsya (bronze or bell-metal), loha (iron), suvarna (gold), rajata 
(silver), sJsa (lead), tdmra (copper), trapu (tin), rajata mdksika (iron-silver 
pyrites or marcasite ore), suvarna mdksika (iron pyrites of golden brown 
colour), srotdnjana (antimony sulphide), iildjatu (bitumen), tuvari (alum), 
etc., are among the metals and minerals, the properties of which are 
described in the Su§ruta Sarnhitd. Of particular importance to us, are the 
details of processes for obtaining different types of alkalis® as well as their 
use. The term used for alkali is ksdra^ and ksdra is among the important 
chemicals of Indian medicine. Alkalis are classified into three types: mild 
{mrdu\ caustic (tiksna) and those of average strength (madhyama). 
Generally the preparation of alkalis consists in the lixivation of the ashes 
of certain plants. For this purpose, some 25 plants are mentioned in the 
Susruta Samhitd, The procedure described is as follows: Select pieces 
(wood, leaves, roots and fruits) of the plants are piled up, a few pieces of 
limestone kept on them and the whole thing then burnt to ashes. Thirty- 
two measures of this ash arc stirred with six measures of water, 
and strained through cloth, and the process is repeated 21 times. The 
extract thus obtained is concentrated by boiling it in a large iron pan. 
During boiling, it is constantly stirred by means of a ladle till the liquid 
becomes clear, pungent and soapy to the touch. At this stage the desired 
quantities (eight measures) each of burnt limestone and conch-shells are 
heated strongly in an iron pan. The mass is then mixed with three quarters 
measure of the above-mentioned liquid and evaporated to obtain a solid 
residue which is then mixed with 64 measures of water and thoroughly 
boiled, with constant agitation by means of a ladle till a concentrate of the 
required consistency results. The concentrated solution is now decanted 
and preserved in closed jars. This is madhyama ksdra. 

If the alkaline extract is boiled to a proper consistency without the 
addition of the burnt shells, an alkali of mild strength {mrdu k^dra) is said 
to result. On the other hand, if the alkaline extract is repeatedly boiled 
with the ashes of some more plants, the product is stated to be a caustic 
or strong alkali (tlk^na k^dra). The foregoing descriptions amply illustrate 

» SS. 5fi., 11.

CHEMICAL PRACTICES AND ALCHEMY 


307 


the experimental technique employed and also the nature of quantitative 
considerations of which the experimentalists were well aware. The method 
of preparation of k^dra was considered to be an art (kald) and, in fact, it 
was recognized as one of the 10 important arts of the Ayurveda. 

Apart from the triple distinctions made of alkalis with reference to 
their strength, three other types of alkaline substances have also been men- 
tioned. They are the carbonate of potash (yavaksdra), trona or natron 
(sarjikak§dra) and borax (fankana). Hot alkaline solutions were generally 
used for treating thin sheets of metals like iron, gold or silver before their 
incorporation into drug compositions. Caustic alkalis also found use for 
treating surgical instruments which were used for incisions, punctures and 
scarifications of the diseased parts of the human body. The word ksdra 
significantly connotes the removal of the unhealthy portions of the body, 
be it of the skin or flesh. 

Ancient Indians, in particular the physicians, knew a number of salts. 
The Su^ruta Samhitd mentions the following six types of salts:® (1) nitre 
{sauvarcala, i.e. potassium nitrate); (2) rock salt (saindhava, i.e. sodium 
chloride with potassium chloride); (3) a reddish brown granular salt (vida), 
probably consisting of a large part of sodium chloride with traces of sodium 
sulphate, alumina, magnesia and iron compounds; (4) fossil salt {audbhida), 
probably a saline deposit consisting chiefly of sodium carbonate and 
magnesium sulphate; (5) sea salt {samudra, sodium chloride with traces 
of magnesium salts); and (6) a kind of saline earth (romaka). 

A number of acids were also known. The organic acids of citrons, 
tamarind, pomegranate and of a few other plant products were in use. The 
earlier texts on medicine do not speak of any mineral acid. In this connec- 
tion it may be noted that some of the compositions including nitre and 
alum used by the Indian alchemists for the purification of metals might have 
constituted the ingredients necessary to give rise to mineral acids in the 
process, although there is no explicit reference to the mineral acids. The 
Indian experimentalists did not seem to have any knowledge of the mineral 
acids in contradistinction to the acids of plant products of which they were 
quite aware. It may be mentioned that the Rasa PradJpa, an iatro-chemical 
text probably belonging to the sixteenth century a.d., gives a detailed process 
for the preparation of a mineral acid called Sankhadrdvaka (i.e. one which 
dissolves conch-shells); the Suvarnatantra, an alchemical text possibly of a 
later date, speaks of :§ankhadrdvaka as a universal solvent, and also refers to 
its property of dissolving metals. From this it seems that the Indians did 
not possess the knowledge of the use of mineral acids for dissolving metals 
before the sixteenth century a.d., though some of the processes employed 
were in the nature of obtaining solvents of the type of mineral acids. 

The Brhatsaifihitd by Varahamihira is another important literary 
source which gives detailed information on the preparation and use of fine 
chemicals like perfumes, scented hair-oils, etc.^ Evidently, the chemical 


® SS, 46, 111, 


Brh.S., 77. 1-17. 



308 A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 

techniques relating to them had reached an advanced stage during the time of 
Varahamihira. Some of the preparations are worthy of mention. In the 
chapter on gandhayukti (preparation of perfumes) several recipes are given of 
compounded or delicately blended perfumes. It has been stated that 
gandharnava (ocean of perfumes) can be prepared from 16 substances, 
if every four of them are permuted variously as desired, and in proportions 
of one, two, three or four parts respectively. Vdlaka, spfkka, aguru, 
madanaka, dhanya, karpura, cola, ghana, saileya, ndgapu^pa, vydghranakha, 
nakha, tagara, karcura, malaya and uslra are the 16 substances men- 
tioned. Not all these substances have been identified from the modem 
scientific point of view. Perhaps vdlaka may be a kind of andropogan 
and aguru, a fragrant aloe wood. What is worthy of note is the quantitative 
approach to blending the perfumes of desired quality. Varahamihira, in a 
tabular form, describes how a number of perfumes of high quality can be 
prepared and says that the number of perfumes resulting from the 16 
ingredients mixed in all possible combinations is 174,720. 

The Brhatsamhitd gives an account of some adamantine compositions 
like vajradepa and vajra-samghdta,^ Vajradepa consists of extracts of 
certain types of plants, fruits, seeds, barks, etc. (like unripe ebony fruit, 
wood-apple), blossoms of silk cotton and guggulu (a fragrant gum; exuda- 
tion of Amuris agallochum). The process described is as follows: ‘Boil 
them in a drona of water and reduce it to an eighth of its original volume. 
Mix the residue with smdhka (probably the resin of Pirns longifolia), 
kmduruka (exudation of deodar), guggulu, linseed, resin of bilva fruit, etc., 
and make it into a paste.’ This glutinous material could be applied on to 
the roofs and walls of temples and mansions. Its life has been stated to 
be ten million years. Vajra-samghdta is a metal-cement consisting of 
eight parts of lead, two of bell-metal and one of iron rust or brass. It is 
melted and poured hot as desired. 

PIGMENTS 

The remains of ancient paintings at Ajanta (second century b.c. to 
sixth century a.d.), Bagh (third to fifth centuries a.d.), Badami (sixth 
century a.d.) and Sittannavasal (seventh to eighth centuries a.d.) give an 
insight into the use of colours as well as the technique of painting 
adopted during this period. The principal colours used are dhdturdga 
(red ochre), haritdla (yellow ochre: arsenic sulphide), indigo blue, 
lapis lazuli blue, kajjala (lamp black; carbon), kha4i-mdti (chalk 
white), geru-mdfi {terra verde) and jangdl (green-coloured verdigris). 
The technique consisted of (i) preparation of the ground in the form of a 
rough plaster and upon it a fine plaster, and (ii) application of the desired 
colours on the ground. The rough plaster was generally a ferruginous 
earth consisting of iron oxide, powdered rock, clay, vegetable, fibres and

paddy husk. The plaster was levelled and polished with a trowel or a 
polishing stone. The fine plaster was one of white lime wash (to a thickness 
of about 0*1 mm.) applied to the rough plaster when the latter was still 
wet. The ground was allowed to dry. Animal glue was used so as to 
serve as the binding medium for the pigments used. The Vismdharmot- 
tara Purina describes the preparation of the ground for painting in a 
methodical way. 

To sum up, the main features of the chemical knowledge and practices 
in India during the post-Vedic as well as the Classical Age seem to bespeak 
a concerted and methodical appVoach. Needless to add that they attracted 
the attention of the contemporary world. Nevertheless, we are in aridity 
regarding the theories concerning these practices. And techniques of ex- 
cellence went ahead of theorizing tendencies. But towards the close of the 
period under reference, a new way of understanding certain chemical sub- 
stances and an equally new way of processing them for a purpose that 
was at once sublime and mystical came on the scene. An esoteric theo- 
retical approach supported by an experimental technique of an entirely 
different character attracted the attention of a particular section of people 
who had faith in the ideals and practices of what is known as Tantrism. 
These constituted the base for alchemy and iatro-chemistry in India. 


ALCHEMY 

Alchemy is the forerunner of modern chemistry. The latter, about 
two hundred years old, has developed as a result of experimentation, 
observation and inference. The former, on the other hand, for over two 
thousand years revolved round only two objectives, viz. (i) the transmutation 
process for converting base metals (like lead, tin, mercury or copper) into 
the noble metals (gold or silver); and (ii) preparation of the Elixir of Life 
for attaining immortality. The objectives were in fact two sides of the 
same coin. For, they were concerned with the problem of change. In 
one case it was a change from the inferior metal to the superior one; in the 
other, it was a change from the despised old age to the exhilarating 
youthful state. To achieve these objectives the alchemists developed com- 
plicated processes and secret practices, whose number was legion, involving 
metals, minerals and herbs. The alchemists, too, had their laboratories 
in which they ceaselessly endeavoured to prepare gold artificially and to 
evolve the EHxir of Life. But, more often than naught, their endeavours 
appeared to be not only mysterious but even superstitious. In addition, 
mystical methods, astrology and allegory influenced not inconsiderably the 
alchemical ideas and practices. 

A brief historical account of alchemy is desirable to understand the 
origin of alchemy in India in a perspective.®’ The word ‘alchemy’ is 
Arabic {al-chemy). It seems to have been derived from the Egyptian khem-it 


Holmyard, pp. 17 ff.

Taylor, pp. 40-55. 



310 


A CONCISE fflSTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


(the black) or the Greek word chyma (black molten metal). Probably the 
art of transmutation of base metals into gold was flourishing in Egypt 
(the country of the black soil) when the Arabs came to know of it. In 
Greece, alchemy was a favourite practice among metal workers. The 
Arabians are said to have added the article aU to chyme or chaemea. 

The origin of alchemy is indeed obscure. However, in different periods 
of history, alchemical thought and practices were extremely popular in China, 
Egypt, Greece, India, Arabia and Western Europe. There is a reasonable 
view held by some scholars that China might have been the original home 
of alchemy. Chinese alchemy seems to be very ancient, probably belong- 
ing to the early centuries before the Christian era, though Wei-Po-Yang, 
the well-known Chinese alchemist, produced the first alchemical treatise 
only in the second century a.d. The Chinese had reverence for cinnabar 
(mercuric sulphide) which occurs naturally in China. They considered it 
as the energetic essence and bestower of long life. The two components of 
cinnabar— mercury and sulphur— were supposed to be the yin (female) and 
yang (male) principles respectively.® This concept was in perfect accord with 
the Chinese religio-philosophic system known as Taoism,^ which not only 
enunciated its own yin and yang principles to interpret nature and man but 
was also concerned with material life and immortality. It is possible 
that Chinese alchemical practice might have found its roots in these ideas, 
with cinnabar as the prime substance. For centuries the alchemists of 
China indulged in strange practices for obtaining the ‘medicine’ or a ‘pill 
of immortality’ as well as converting mercury or base metals into gold. 
It is not unlikely that the cinnabar-centred Chinese alchemical thought 
might have influenced similar ideas in other countries which in turn appear 
to have modified the main alchemical theme to suit their own religio- 
philosophical speculations. 

The history of alchemy tells us that this ancient practice was not all 
fiction and mystery. For example, in Alexandria in Egypt, as alchemy 
grew, it tried to acquire a rational basis. By about the fifth century b.c., 
the Greek thinkers had developed a theory of four elements: earth, fire, 
water and air, and the four primary qualities: hot, cold, dry and moist. 
Aristotle (384-322 B.c.) conceived of these elements and their qualities as 
emphasizing the unity of matter amidst all the changes. 

The ‘primary matter’ as he called it could undergo transformation into 
different substances depending upon the primary qualities affecting it. 
Thus, for example, the primary matter, a potential one, would become 
earth with the pair of primary qualities, cold and dry; water vnth cold and 
wet; /re with hot and dryness; and air with hot and wetness. In any case 
this theory appeared to explain satisfactorily the problem of change.® 

The alchemists of the Hellenistic culture of Alexandria in Egypt were 
quick to realize the importance of this theory; for this theory held out 
the possibility of transmuting base metals into gold or silver by changing

their qualities. A change in qualities meant the emergence of a new metal 
and tWs perhaps represented the transmutation process. Of the qualities, 
colour was the most perceptible one, and the attempt was to bring about a 
change in colour of a metal like copper or tin, to that of gold or silver. The 
concept of change received support also from astrological beliefs. It was

thought that a base metal could be converted into a noble metal under 
proper astrological influences. The then known metals were also associated 
with the sun, moon and the planets. If the Greek theory of matter was one, 
the astrological belief was another which shaped the later alchemical thought 
in Egypt. Pseudo-Democritos (Bolos) probably belonging to the second 
century b.c. and Zosimos who lived in the fourth century a.d. were the noted 
exponents of alchemy in Egypt. 

Alchemical practice in Egypt came under yet another influence. The 
skilled metal workers and other artisans attached to the temples knew the 
‘dyeing* of metal, stone and fabrics. They were also adepts in the art of 
producing cheaper substitutes for gold or silver. To them, then, alchemy 
meant an occult gift enabling them to transform the inferior metals to the 
noble metals too. Only they thought that the inferior metal should be 
‘killed’, obtained in a native state and then processed suitably to transmute 
them into either silver or gold. 

In the Middle Ages alchemy was dominant in the Arabian countries. 
The Arabic alchemy, which appears to have drawn its ideas from the alchemy 
of Alexandria as well as that of China, specially emphasized what has come 
to be familiarly known as the sulphur-mercury theory. All substances, in 
particular meUds, were regarded to have been formed by the interaction of the 
two principles. Sulphur and Mercury, Sulphur represented an abstract 



312 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


principle composed of hot and dry, while mercury represented cold and 
moist. In essence, sulphur (the Sophie-sulphur as it was called to distinguish 
it from ordinary sulphur) meant the property of combustibility and stood for 
the element fire. Sophic-mercury meant the fusibility of metals and stood 
for the element water. 

The alchemical sulphur-mercury theory developed also on mystical 
lines. The mystic sect, called the ‘Brethren of Purity*, was the chief 
exponent of Islamic alchemy. The conception upheld by the Brethren of 
Purity was that macrocosm was recapitulated in microcosm, the man. 
They thought of even the natural substances like metals and minerals 
in terms of ‘bodies’ and ‘spirits* corresponding to the human body and 
soul. 

Most of the Arabic alchemical works have been attributed to one by 
name Geber or Jabir ibn Hayyan (about eighth century a.d.) who classi- 
fied substances into spirits, metals and bodies. He also emphasized the 
operational qualities such as fusion, combustion, evaporation, pulverization 
and malleability. Geber himself was a great experimentalist in a number 
of medicinal preparations as well as an alchemist. 

It would appear that the Islamic alchemy gradually found its way into 
western Europe by about the twelfth century a.d. The Arabic texts on 
alchemy were translated into Latin. Mystical representations and symbol- 
ism of alchemy found new and faithful followers. Of great interest was 
the spectacular emergence of a number of esoteric symbols including those 
of the masculine and feminine, the active and the passive. The synthesis 
of Sophie-sulphur and Sophic-mercury, the two principles of union, was 
considered to be the ‘Philosopher’s Stone’, the perfect and potent trans- 
muting agent. This is a concept of the later European alchemy. In line 
with the Philosphcr’s Stone was the life-prolonging agent which would 
transmute man from a state of ageing to one of long life, and went under 
the enchanting name, Elixir of Life. The Philosopher’s Stone as well as the 
allied Elixir of Life were the goal sublime of alchemists, ever in sight and 
never reached. 

The imagery of Sophie-sulphur and Sophic-mercury went further and 
even included ‘Philosophical water’, also called ‘menstruum’, associated 
with the Philosopher’s Stone.® In later alchemical writings, these enig- 
matic and mystical ideas found different expressions which are too numerous 
to be recounted here. A characteristic of them was the form of a union 
of masculine-feminine principles and a conjoining liquid called menstruum 
which was supposed to serve as a medium for the union. The menstruum 
was symbolically represented in the form of a dragon or serpent which 
was, in fact, an important alchemical imagery bound with religious 
and mythological conceptions. Religion, mydiology, number-superstition 
and symbolism exerted profound influence on the European alchemy 
too.

Indian Alchemy and its Characteristics 

In India, the alchemical ideas grew also around a male-female symbol- 
ism; and the symbolism was naturally cast in an indigenous imagery. In a 
mythologically erotic background mercury is conceived as the male principle 
(symbolically as the seminal essence of Siva) and sulphur as the female 
principle (symbolically as the menstrual flux of his consort or of the celestial 
nymphs). In its twin aspects, viz. efforts to transmute base metals into 
gold and the pursuit of the Elixir of Life, alchemy does not seem to have 
made its appearance in India before the fifth or sixth century a.d. But 
in the next seven or eight centuries, the Indian alchemy had considerable 
following. This was the period of what is known as tantrism which ad- 
mitted into its fold all, irrespective of caste, sex and creed.® The Indian 
tantrism which is a peculiar complex of thought and practice re- 
presents a human urge not only to attain material prosperity and immor- 
tality but also to unite with the divine by adopting diverse practices.*' 
Alchemy was adopted possibly as part of the mystic practice by certain sec- 
tions of the tantriks in India. 

The Sanskrit equivalent in general of the term alchemy is rasavidya 
and that of the alchemist, rasavadin. The word rasa as used in the 
alchemical literature means mercury. It should be emphasized that mercury 
is central to the whole Indian alchemical thought and held in veneration 
because of its presumed mythical origin (the creative energy of Siva, one 
of the Indian Divine Trinity). As a result, mercury itself stands out as 
divine in the alchemical practices, preparations and processes. Mercurial 
preparations are supposed to give long life, youthful vigour, high mental 
powers and even the rare faculty of moving invisibly in space {khecara- 
gamana). Significantly mercury is also referred to as parada which literally 
means that it enables human beings to ‘cross the ocean of life’. 

There does not appear to be any theoretical basis for the alchemical 
thought in India, as the theory of four elements which, as stated before, 
supported the western alchemy in the early centuries of the Christian era. 
Searching in vain for such a sustaining theoretical content, one is struck, 
instead, by certain characteristics of the Indian alchemical literature such 
as the praise of mercury in the introductory portions, explanations of the 
origin of lead, sulphur, mica and a few other substances also in a mythical 
way, the eight mahdrasas, the eight uparasas, the eight dhatus or metallic 
substances and also precious stones, elaborate processes for purifying 
alchemical substances, use of herbs and symbolical forms (paribhdsd). Above 
all, the well-known texts themselves are unfolded in the form of a dialogue 
between the male God and iSakti (his feminine energetic part). Some of 
these texts even speak of the eight siddhis in the same way as the tantrik 
texts. The eight siddhis (animddi a^fasiddhis) relate to powers of assuming 
minute dimension (ariimd), huge dimension (mahimd), lightness {laghimd), 
heaviness (garimd), obtaining everything (prdpti), possessing objects of

pleasure (prdkamya), attaining supremacy (Wtvd) and subduing or be- 
witching (va^itvd).^ 

The foregoing characteristics and the fact that there are in these texts 
passages which speak of initiation and ritual practices, similar to those 
found in the tantrik texts, unmistakably point out that these alchemical ideas 
could not have but flourished in India at a time when tantrism was a domi- 
nant practice. 

Literature on Alchemy in India 

The literature on Indian alchemy is notably voluminous. But it is not 
of a varied type, because generally the texts have more or less the same 
form and tone. Also the presentation of the tantrik elements is nearly 
the same in these texts. Nevertheless, the alchemical texts are not usually 
recognized as part of the tantrik literature.* They come under the category 
of the rasa^astra, signifying a systematic treatment of the new knowledge 
and practice relating to the use of mercurial compounds and a host of other 
substances as medicines. In fact, the rasasdstra texts are, by and large, the 
iatro-chemical texts. 

The dates of most of these texts are generally uncertain, but they 
belong possibly to a period between the ninth and the eighteenth centuries 
A.D., the period between the tenth and the fourteenth centuries being 
perhaps the most flourishing one. The following are among the important

stantially different from what has been known. Nevertheless, there are 
a few admittedly tantrik texts which deal with alchemical ideas as part 
of their psycho-experimental-symbolic treatment of the tantrik goals and 
related practices. Among them mention may be made of MQtrkdbhedatan- 
iram^ and Rasdrnavakalpa of the Rudraydmala^ in Sanskrit. Besides there are 
a number of texts in a few languages other than Sanskrit, like Tamil, Telugu, 
Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali, Marathi, Oriya and Gujarati. Particular 
mention should be made of the Tamil texts. There appear to be about two 
hundred works in Tamil on the Siddha system of medicine having alchemical 
ideas and of them special importance attaches to the Amudakalaijfidnamj 
Muppu, Muppuvaippu, Muppucun^aniy Carakku, Guruseynir^ Paccaivetfu-

Muppu-sutram by Romar§i; Karpavidhi and Sutram by Kailasa Muni; 
Vdkyam by Macca Muni; Sutram by Suryanandar; dind Jndnam by Satya 
Muni. So far these texts have remained practically unstudied and a 
comparison between the Sanskrit and the Tamil sources would be possible 
only when the latter are studied in detail with reference to their alchemical 
ideas. 

Early Ideas on Rejuvenation 

At this stage, it is desirable to understand the difference between the 
alchemical concepts of attaining perpetual youth as well as immortality, 
and the ancient ideas on rejuvenation. The former are in the main con- 
cerned with the use of certain compositions in an esoteric way, faith and 
symbolism playing a dominant role in such uses. The latter, on the other 
hand, are in the nature of well thought-out therapeutic procedures which 
are not governed by esoteric considerations, but by their physiological effects. 

In ancient times, the Indians had developed not only exhilarating 
elixirs but also compositions for rejuvenation. But they had no alchemical 
undertone. In the Rgveda are found references to somarasa^ the juice 
extracted from the Soma plant {Sarcostema viminalis ?), Somarasa, an 
exhilarating elixir, was regarded even as a drink of the immortal gods. There 
are nearly a hundred and twenty hymns of the Soma in the Rgveda, A close 
examination of these hymns, however, reveals that the Soma juice is 
extolled as a divine drink which gives vigour, wealth and happiness. Never- 
theless, it should be noted that this intoxicating drink used to be taken 
along with milk, clarified butter or barley only by the priests and the privi- 
leged during the performance of sacrifice (yaJHa). 

The Ayurvedic classics, the Suiruta and Caraka Sarphitds, have given 
due importance to the compositions used for increasing virility and longevity.

A CX>NCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


The practitioners of Ayurveda were as much concerned with the cure of 
the bodily diseases as with the maintenance of youthful form and vitality 
of the body as it aged. Increased powers of mind, a total immunity pos- 
sibly against all diseases, good fortune and charming personality were 
also their goal. The medical treatment known as vajikarana, for increasing 
the strength and virile power, forms a part of the cikitsd as explained in 
the Caraka and the Susruta Samhitds. For this purpose, a number of 
compositions are mentioned and these, however, do not make even a 
reference to mercury. The Susruta mentions the rasdyanas^ (elixirs and 
rejuvenators) capable of making a human body possess an almost life-long 
youth and extraordinary mental faculties. It also speaks of compositions 
(e.g. iatapdka vacdgh(ta) which could make one live for five hundred years. 
In the preparation of these rasdyanas, it may be noted, metals are not used. 
Essentially the rasdyanas are herbal although sometimes gold is used along 
with other substances of vegetable origin. 

Soma as an elixir finds a place also in the Susruta Samhitd. The Soma 
elixir is supposed to enable one to live for ten thousand years with a youth- 
ful body and all the enjoyments associated with it. It is claimed that he 
who consumes this elixir becomes superhuman, and that his muscular 
energy will not be inferior to the combined powers of a thousand wild ele- 
phants. He can move about in space freely and majestically with re- 
splendant personality. Nevertheless the Soma elixir could be taken only 
by the select section of the population.*' 

The other Ayurvedic classic, the Caraka Sarnhitd, in its sections on vdji- 
karana and rasdyana which form part of the cikitsdsthdna, describes certain 
processes and recipes for giving unrivalled strength to the body and a 
longevity of even a thousand years. A number of other vitalizers of vege- 
table origin are also mentioned. A reference, however, is made to the 
use of metals like iron, gold and silver as components of certain elixirs. 
Again, as in the Susruta, the emphasis in the Caraka Samhitd is still on 
herbal preparations. One could live as long as ten thousand years without 
any ailment by drinking extracts of some of them. Like the Susruta, 
the Caraka also enjoins that the rejuvenation and virilification are meant 
only for the privileged castes.*' 

Possible Origin of Indian Alchemy 

But to live long in perpetual youth and to experience that which is 
divine in this very life have a strong appeal to every human being. These 
human inclinations incessantly try to surpass the privileged attitudes and 
rigid caste structures, and go out in search of systems of thought and practice 
conducive to their realization. In India, the tantras offered such a system 
of thought and practice in an ingenious manner. The tantrik siddhi was 
thought of in different forms such as janmaja (due to birth), o^adhija 


« SS. a., 26 , 30 . » SS, CL, 29 , 8 . « CS. CL, 4 , 38 . 



CHEMICAL PRACTICES AND ALCHEMY

(due to some medical elixirs), mantraja (due to magic syllables), tapoja 
(due to penance) and samadhija (due to meditation).® The tantriks 
endeavoured to attain the siddhis by several paths, one of them being 
the use of certain compositions containing compounds of mercury, sulphur, 
mica and several other metallic substances. To achieve the highest 
in this life itself the tantras advocated preservative medicaments to the 
body in esoteric ways. In this respect, mercury as well as mercurial 
preparations, sulphur and mica assumed great importance and so became 
intertwined with the tantrik male-female symbolism and ritual practices. 

Now what may be the origin of the mercury-based alchemy in India? 
It would appear that the Indian tantrism during its diversified growth 
had absorbed some Chinese elements also.^ The orthodox tantrik texts, like 
the Yamala^ speak of Mahaclna as a place to be visited for attaining maha- 
siddhi. There is also a view that the Buddhist alchemist, Nagaijuna, went 
to Mahaclna under the name of Va^istha for this purpose. Nila Sarasvatl, 
a tantrik goddess, is stated to be Chinese in origin while another tantrik 
goddess, Tdrd, is believed to have emanated from the country of Bhota 
(now comprising Tibet). 

As indicated before, the alchemical literature in Sanskrit is presented 
as a dialogue between Siva and Parvatl in their different forms, of which 
perhaps the most significant are the forms of Bhairava and Bhairavi. Siva 
is also worshipped in a form known as linga. Of significant interest in this 
respect is the fact that in Tamil, lingam means cinnabar (mercuric 
sulphide) also, and that cinnabar forms one of the constituents of a 
composition (as(abandha) used during the installation of divine idols. 
Tradition has it that cinnabar is the source of divine energy and possesses 
the creative principle. 

In its fully developed form, the mercury-based alchemy in India relates 
to the male-female symbolism (Siva and Parvatl), the Bhairava form of 
Siva as the creative emblem, and its association with cinnabar. As stated 
already, the Chinese alchemy centred round cinnabar, the compound of 
yang and yin. Though Chinese alchemy is old (c. third century b.c.), 
Taoism and Chinese alchemy were flourishing in China during the Tang 
period. Historically the cultural intercourse between India and China 
was notable between the third and the seventh centuries a.d.® It is reason- 
able to presume that the alchemy based on cinnabar and its male-female 
symbolism might have attracted the attention of the Indian tantriks during 
the same period. But in its growth in India, this alchemy had to adapt 
itself to the corresponding Indian elements, including the mythico-religious 
practices. The followers of the tantras might have modified it with their 
own originality. The most remarkable fact is that, in a century or two, 
the alchemical knowledge became formalized in a way characteristically 
Indian. Perhaps because of this, even the male-female symbolism found

a different expression. In the Chinese alchemy, mercury is the female 
principle and sulphur the male principle, while opposite is the case with 
the Indian alchemy. 

Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that the possibility of interaction 
between the Islamic alchemy and the Indian alchemy at some stage cannot 
be ruled out, even though evidence to this effect is scanty at present. One 
of the Siddhars of Tamilnadu, Ramadevar, says in his work on alchemy® 
that he went to Mecca, assumed the name of Yakub and taught the Arabians 
the alchemical art. It is significant that some of the purification processes 
and substances of alchemical significance are common to both the Islamic 
and the Indian alchemy. This field calls for further studies in order to 
understand the extent and form of such an interaction. 

mercury: its powers 

Mercury, extolled by the rasavadins as the king of rasas, has different 
names: parada, rasa, suta, mahdrasa, rasendra, svarmkdraka, sarvadhdtupati, 
and, more significantly, Sivaja, SivavJrya and Harablja (seed of Siva). 
Further, it has been regarded as the potent agent for bestowing happiness 
and worldly prosperity on man leading him ultimately to a state of eternal 
bliss. The Rasaratnasamuccaya asserts that ‘he who denies mercury, the 
creative principle of Siva, will decay in hell age after age’.^ 

The gamut of alchemical literature describes vividly several composi- 
tions containing mercury as one of the valuable ingredients. These com- 
positions are presumed to confer an extraordinary longevity and also enable 
the conversion of base metals into gold. Thus, for example, the sublimate 
of a composition including mercury, rubbed with an equal weight of gold 
and admixed with sulphur and borax is said to possess a property by means 
of which the consumer would develop an imperishable body. Likewise, 
a composition containing treated mercury has been stated to acquire the 
power of converting a base metal into a thousand times its weight of gold 
according to the text, the Kdkacandeharimata Tantra.^ The well-known 
rasa§dstra texts abound in elaborate details of transmutation processes 
involving generally the use of cinnabar, mercury or mercurial ash. 

In general, five types of transmutation are mentioned lepa (smearing 
copper or silver foils with the potent paste of mercury); k^epa (throwing 
mercury into molten copper or silver); kmta vedha (pouring processed 
mercury into metal to be transmuted); dhuma vedha (subjecting the base 
metal to the action of ‘fumes’ (of mercury)); and sabdavedha (effecting 
transmutation by the ‘impact’ (of mercury)). It may, however, be men- 
tioned that there are a few transmutation processes which do not explicitly 
envisage the use of mercury. Moreover, some of the texts differ from one 
another in giving the details of the same transmutation process. The

following examples give a glimpse of the nature of transmutation as stated 
in a few texts. It must be emphasized that the number of transmutation 
processes mentioned in the texts is very large, and it is almost impossible 
to give a gist of each of them here. 

The Rasdrnava gives an account of the conversion of lead into gold as 
follows : leaves of lead smeared with the paste made of red variety of karavlra 
{Nerium odorum) and manahMld (realgar) macerated twenty times in tama- 
rind extract, are to be roasted over cow-dung fire into ash. This ash when 
deposited in a crucible smeared with a paste of one-third part of rasaka 
(calamine), one part of darada (cinnabar) and one-fourth of sulphur, 
realgar, etc., and heated, turns into gold.® The same text states that tin 
could be converted into silver with the help of mercurial ash as follows: 
one pala of mercurial ash, two of tin powder, two of silver ash, five of 
hfikhacurna (powder of conch), eight each of common salt and borax, 
rubbed together and pressed with the milky juice of Euphorbia neriifolia 
is to be roasted fourteen times. Then the whole mass is to be stirred with 
an iron rod and again heated in a crucible; now it becomes silver. Silver 
can also be transmuted into gold with the aid of copper.^ For this purpose, 
hema mdksika (golden pyrites) and salt are mixed with honey and clarified 
butter so that the mass becomes red like saffron. It is then subjected to 
ndgapu(a (a type of prolonged heating). If equal quantities of this treated 
substance and copper are mixed well and smeared on the leaves of silver, 
the latter turns into gold. The Rasaprakdsasudhakara has a different process 
in this respect. ‘Golden pyrites, ndga (ksid), gandhaka (sulphur), sutaka 
(mercury), hihgula (cinnabar), manahsild (realgar) and pure gold are pow- 
dered and kept in a glass vessel containing the juice of sdka {Tectona 
grandis). It is subjected to a type of prolonged heating (lavanapufa) and 
then made into a paste. Silver, if treated with this paste, turns into gold.’^ 

According to the Rasahrdaya, silver can be converted into gold by the 
following method: mercury is to be covered with a powder made of cin- 
nabar, realgar, orpiment, roasted golden pyrites, ‘killed’ lead and a kind 
of substance called kahkustha, and agitated well with the oil of kafigunl 
(Celastrus paniculatus). The mass is heated in steam. If leaves of silver 
are treated with this composition, they turn into gold of excellent quality. 
It is stated that the weight of the composition used should be three times 
the weight of silver. The Rasahrdaya also gives an account of the conversion 
of bell-metal {kdrpsya) into gold. The bell-metal is to be heated with a 
number of substances, including compounds of mercury and the juice 
of paddy in a vessel for four months before it acquires the potency of 
getting transmuted into gold. Copper heated with an equal weight of 
tdla (orpiment) and mhga (tin) is, according to the same text, turned into 
silver.^* The Suvarnatantra^ gives a detailed account of a bulbous root 
which exudes a liquid capable of dissolving a needle when pierced into

the root. When mercury is rubbed with this bulb in a mortar and then 
heated in a crucible, it is said to acquire the property of converting a thou- 
sand times its own weight of the base metal into gold. Thus the exudate of 
the bulb is regarded as having extraordinary qualities for bringing about 
transmutation. Another text, the DhdtumaHjarJy speaks of a process by means 
of which mercury, molten sulphur and orpiment, when suitably processed 
so as to assume the form of fumes, can convert inferior metals into gold. 

What happens chemically during the process of transmutation, which is 
rather a complicated one, cannot be surmised until an experimental veri- 
fication is attempted from the modem chemical point of view. It would, 
however, appear that the colour of the inferior metal, say copper or tin, 
changes into that of the noble metal, gold or silver respectively. The 
coloration that occurs may be uniform and too intimate enough to expose, 
under ordinary conditions, the true colour of the inferior metal. The 
specific gravity and tlie other normal physical characteristics of the trans- 
muted metal are likely to manifest themselves, as a result of skilful mani- 
pulation of the ingredients such as mercury or its compounds, arsenic salts, 
sulphur, and some quantities of the noble metals themselves. The Indian 
rasavadlns knew the distinction between the artificial ‘gold’ and the real 
gold. In one of the Tamil texts on alchemy (Amudakalaijndnam by 
Agastya),® it has been stated clearly that if the artificial ‘gold’ (emam) and 
the natural gold (tahgam) are subjected to calcination separately, and the ashes 
(bhasma) so obtained are treated in such a way as to make the ‘face’ of 
the metal appear, the difference between the two types of metals can be 
easily recognized. In other words, the base metal, which has been trans- 
muted, can be converted into its oxide and the latter is reduced to the 
metallic state again, while the real gold remains unaffected by this method. 

Processing of Mercury 

One of the important aspects of the rasavidya relates to the eighteen 
treatments or samskdras which mercury has to undergo, if it is to exhibit 
its supreme powers not only as a trusted promoter of long and prosperous 
life but also to convert base metals into the noble ones. The Indian 
rasavadins adopt the following for this purpose: (1) svedanam (steaming 
or heating using a water bath); (2) mardanam (grinding or trituration); 
(3) mUrchanam (‘swooning’ or making mercury lose its form); (4) utthdpanam 
(also uddharana; revival of form); (5) pdtanam (sublimation or distillation); 
(6) rodhanam or bodhanam (potentiation); (7) niydmanam (restraining); 
(8) sandlpanam (stimulation or kindling); (9) gaganabhaksartam (also 
abhrakagrdsa or consumption of ‘essence’ of mica); (10) cdranam (amal- 
gamation); (11) garbhadruti (liquefaction — internal); (12) bdhyadruti 
(liquefaction— external); (13) jdranam (digestion or assimilation); (14) rah- 
janam (coloration); (15) sdranam (blending or preparation for trans- 
formation); (16) sanikrdmanam (acquiring power of transformation); 


Amudakalaijhdnamy v. 1074.

( 17 ) vedhavidhi (actual transformation or transmutation); and ( 18 ) sanra 
yoga!^ (becoming fit for internal use). 

In some important texts are found elaborate details of these 
samskdras. They include rubbing with various plant juices and extracts, 
incorporation of sulphur, mica, saltpetre, certain alkaline substances, 
cow’s urine and sour gruel. It is indeed very difficult to read exact scientific 
meanings into these processes which, it is clear, are motivated by an in- 
finite belief in the divine potentialities of mercury. What merits attention, 
however, is that mercury should be subjected to a series of methodical 
processes to make it eminently fit for internal use. Mercury from cinnabar 
is considered to be of good quality, and the first eight of the afore-mentioned 
eighteen processes are not deemed necessary for it. 

Most of the important rasasdstra texts refer invariably to these samskdras 
in one way or the other. The Rasdrnava^ mentions eight samskdras although 
it makes a reference to four more. The Rasahrdaya^ and the Rasaprakdsa 
Sudhdkara^ describe the eighteen sainskdras in considerable detail. Briefly 
the different samskdras are as follows: svedana: consists in steaming mercury 
in a water bath with a number of vegetable and mineral substances in- 
cluding some salts and alkalis— this process is said to remove the undesirable 
impurities present in mercury ;?nardana: rubbing steamed mercury in a mortar 
with vegetable and acidic substances— this process is said to remove some 
more impurities and thus confer good qualities on mercury; murchana: 
rubbing mercury in a mortar with another set of vegetable substances 
including kanyd kumdrj, citraka, and the three myrobalans, till it loses 
its own character and form; several unwanted impurities of mercury are 
said to be removed by this process; utthdpana: steaming mercury again 
in alkalis, salts, the three myrobalans, alum, etc., and then rubbing in sun- 
light so that the characteristics of mercury are brought into play again; 
pdtana (three types, viz. urdhva (upwards), adha (downwards) and tiryak 
(sideways) pdtanas): rubbing mercury with alkalis, salts, etc., and subject- 
ing to distillation; rodhana: mixing the distilled mercury with saline 
water in a closed pot — this process is believed to restore the ‘vigour’ or 
potency of mercury; niydmana: continuation of the process by steaming 
mercury for three days with a number of plant products, alum, borax, 
iron sulphate, etc. — this process is said to restrain the motility of mercury; 
sandipana: steaming with alum, black pepper, sour gruel, alkali and some 
vegetable substances — this is to ‘kindle’ the desire of mercury to attain the 
power of consumption; grdsa or gaganagrdsa: fixation of the desired degree 
of the ‘essence’ of mica for its consumption; edrana: boiling mercury with 
sour gruel, leaves of some kinds of cereal plants, alum, etc., for a week — 
by this mercury is made to consume mica; garbhadruti: treating mercury 
with other metallic substances so that the ‘essences’ of the latter become 
liquefied and thus they may pass through a piece of cloth; bahyadruti: the

* essences' of the minerals or metallic substances to be consumed, becomi 
molten externally; jarana: heating mercury with the desired minerals 
metals, alkalis and salts so that they are digested and assimilated; rahjan 
a complex process involving the treatment of mercury with gold, silvt 
copper, sulphur, mica and salts in such a way that the former attaii 
different colours; sarana: digesting mercury with gold, silver, etc., in a 
oil-base so as to increase its ability for transformation; kramana: smearin 
mercury with a number of plant extracts, mineral substances, human mill 
etc., and then heating with a view to enabling it to possess transmutin 
powers; vedhana: rubbing the treated mercury with oil and a few othe 
materials so that it results in actual transmutation. 

The rasavadins believe that mercury, after it has undergone sequen 
tially the seventeen processes, has all the powers of transmutation. A 
this stage it should be tested for its powers and, if the test is positive, i 
should be used for the eighteenth process leading to its assimilation intc 
and rejuvenation of the body.® 

The rasasdstra texts in which, as stated before, mercury occupies the 
pride of place, are very important from the point of view of the chemical 
processes concerning not only mercury but also several other metals and 
minerals, which they relate in a methodical form. The texts describe 
these processes in the context of the preparation of various mineral medi- 
cines and are thus iatro-chemical in content. They emphasize the effective- 
ness of the medicinal compositions based on minerals or metallic prepa- 
rations, used for curing a number of diseases. For our purpose, the 
classification of substances, processes employed for purification, and 
methods of preparing different chemical compounds as described in these 
texts deserve attention. 


CLASSIFICATION 

The well-known rasasdstra texts like the Rasahrdaya, the Rasdrnava, the 
Rasaratnasamuccaya and the Rasaprakdsasudhdkara have classified the 
chemical substances into mahdrasa, uparasa, dhdtu, ratna and visa. There is 
also a category of substances designated as sddharana rasa. The reason for 
such a classification is not very clear. According to tradition, the mahd- 
rasas and the uparasas are classified in the order in which they find their 
usefulness with reference to mercury (rasendra). There is also a view 
that mercury alone has the appellation of rasa, and all the others are 
called uparasas. Generally, the mahdrasas, eight in number, are: abhraka 
(mica), vaikrdnta (a precious stone having eight surfaces and six angles, 
probably tourmaline), mdksika (copper pyrites), vimala (iron pyrites), Mdjatu 
(bitumen), sasyaka (copper sulphate), capala (a compound of bismuth or 


« The above information is based on the discussions with Dr. D. S. Joshi, Department of

selenium) and rasaka. The eight uparasas are: gandhaka (sulphur), gairika 
(red ochre), kaslsa (iron sulphate), tuvarl (alum), tdlaka (orpiment), manah- 
Slid (realgar), dnjana (coUyrium; compounds of antimony) and kankusfha 
(probably tinstone or cassiterite).® Some of the texts dilfer from one 
another in the number of mahd- and uparasas as well as the substances 
comprising them. While the Rasaratnasamuccaya gives the above classifica- 
tion, another text, the Rasaprakdsasudhdkara, considers rdjavarta (lapis 
lazuli) as a mahdrasa in the place of capala.^ The Rasahrdaya, on the other 
hand, does not consider mica as a mahdrasa, but regards kdnta or loadstone 
as a mahdrasaS The Rasdrnava includes darada (cinnabar) among the 
mahdrasas and rdjavarta among the uparasas.^ 

Under the category of dhdtus, usually seven metals are named: svarm 
(gold), rajata or tdra (silver), tdmra (copper), loha (iron), ndga (lead), vahga 
(tin) and yasada (zinc). But, the three alloys (misraloha), viz. brass (pittala), 
bell-metal (kdmsya) and a mixture of five metals (vartaka), also come under 
the category of dhatu. Again, some of the texts differ from one another 
in this scheme. The Rasdrnava^ mentions six metals including copper, 
while the Rasaprakasasudhakara^ recognizes copper under the category of 
‘odorous’ metals. On the other hand, the Rasaratnasamuccaya does not 
accord a place to copper among the dhdtus. 

The ratnas generally are precious gems. The principal gems used 
by the rasavadins are: vaikrdnta (also classed under mahdrasa), suryakdnta 
(sun-stone; aventurine feldspar mainly containing silicate of sodium and 
potassium with disseminated particles of red iron oxide which cause fire- 
like flashes of colour), candrakanta (moon-stone; a type of feldspar con- 
taining silicates of aluminium, sodium, potassium, calcium, barium, etc., 
which possesses a bluish pearly opalescence), hJraka (diamond), mauktika 
(pearl), garudodgdra (emerald), rdjavarta (lapis lazuli), marakata (topaz), 
nJla (sapphire) and padmaraga (ruby).^' Ruby, sapphire, topaz, emerald 
and diamond are considered to be superior, as also are pearls of big size and 
bright appearance. Sun-stone, moon-stone, amethyst, lapis lazuli, etc., are 
referred to as minor gems. 

Under the categories of visas and sadhdrana rasas a number of plant 
products and minerals are mentioned, which need only a passing mention

The minerals or metals are invariably subjected to purification processes 
which are rather complicated ones. Though these processes are meant for 
‘purifying’ the substances, more often than naught, some extraneous 
material is added onto them. In general, purification means, according to 
the rasasdstra texts, removal of the deleterious principles present in the 
naturally occurring substances, so that they become fit for internal use.

There are a good number of such processes in these texts. A few examples 
may be cited. 

Sulphur is purified by melting it in the medium of cow’s ghee and 
straining the molten mass through a cloth into milk or the juice of Bhrhga- 
raja kept in a pot.® It is then washed with warm water and the process 
repeated several times. In another process, the mouth of a vessel containing 
milk is tied with a piece of cloth over which is placed powdered sulphur. 
This is then covered with an earthen bowl which is heated from outside 
so that sulphur melts and drops gradually into milk. Purification of sulphur 
is considered necessary as otherwise the impure sulphur, when taken in, 
would produce harmful effects such as loss of beauty, strength and vision. 
Mica is purified by heating it strongly and adding the hot powdered sub- 
stance into a mixture of sour gruel, cow’s urine, decoction of the three 
myrobalans, cow’s milk, etc. The process is repeated seven times.*' 
Vaikranta is purified by boiling it with the decoction of kulattha (horse- 
gram). The deleterious principles of maksika can be removed in the same 
way. Mercury is purified by rubbing it for three days with the decoction 
of certain plants like kuman (Aloe indica), citraka (Plumbago zeylanica) and 
red mustard, or by rubbing it with lime and filtering through a cloth. 
Thereafter it is again rubbed with some quantity of garlic and common salt, 
and washed.® The gems are purified by subjecting them to the action of 
the ‘vapours’ of a plant called jayantl Metals, in general, are purified by 
heating and subsequently immersing them in butter milk, sour gruel, cow’s 
urine and the decoction of kulattha. 

Preparations 

The rasavMns had undoubtedly acquired remarkable experience in the 
methods of preparing a number of compounds of mercury, and also con- 
verting some of the minerals into what is known as bhasma. The principal 
compounds of mercury are rasakarpura (mercuric chloride), rasapuspa 
(mercurous chloride), rasasindura (red form of mercuric sulphide), kajjall 
(black form of mercuric sulphide) and makaradhvaja (a sulphide of mer- 
cury). Generally the metals and minerals are converted into bhasmas for 
internal use as medicines. 

Rasakarpura is prepared by rubbing pure mercury repeatedly with a salt 
(audbhida lavana) and the juice of snuhi (Euphorbia neriifolia). It is then 
taken in a bottle, the outside of which is coated with mud, and heated 
uniformly on a salt-bed (lavana yantra) for a day.^ A white mass 
of rasakarpura results. Rasapuspa is prepared as follows: Purified 
mercury is intimately mixed with an equal quantity of rock salt and ferrous 
sulphate (kasJsa) by rubbing the two for a long time. The mixture is then 
placed in a glass bottle, the outside of which is coated with mud and rag,

and carefully heated. When the fumes start emanating from the bottle, 
the mouth of the bottle is closed by a piece of chalk and molasses. The 
heating is continued for six hours. Rasapuspa collects at the neck of the 
bottle as a white substance. 

Rasasindura is obtained by heating an intimate mixture of mercury 
and sulphur in equal quantities on a sand-bath for about twelve 
hours. Sulphur in excess goes out as evidenced by the pale blue flame 
emerging out of the container which is generally a coloured and thick-walled 
glass bottle, the outside of which is coated as usual with mud and rag. 
Mercuric sulphide deposits at the upper part of the bottle as a pinkish red 
substance. Kajjali is the black variety of mercuric sulphide which is ob- 
tained by rubbing thoroughly three parts of mercury with one part of 
sulphur. 

The most popular preparation called makaradhvaja contains mercuric 
sulphide and certain stimulants like camphor, pepper and cloves. During 
its preparation a certain amount of gold is also added. 

The preparation of bhasma involves considerable skill. Generally, 
the bhasmas are oxides in a finely powdered form. The process is one of 
incineration of the metallic substance, after the metal or the mineral is 
treated as desired, usually with sulphur, lime juice or the extracts of certain 
plants like kumdri and musall The substance is subjected to prolonged 
heating which is technically known as puta by means of which the former 
becomes more and more refined and medicinally potent. The source of 
heat is the fire of cow-dungs and, depending upon the quantity of the cow- 
dung cakes used as also the way in which they are heaped, different degrees 
of heat are sought to be given to the substance. The substance itself is 
placed in an earthen flat container and enclosed by another, and sealed 
with mud plaster. The puta-pdka, as the process is called, is believed to 
produce extraordinary qualities, both physical and chemical, in the metallic 
substance, now called the bhasma. The bhasma is an extremely fine powder, 
very light and, when thrown on water, just spreads itself as a thin film 
on it. Several types of pufas^ are recommended for processing different 
metallic substances, involving many operational techniques with a view 
to obtaining the most efficient compositions. For example, in what is 
known as mahdpufam, a cubical pit — three feet in length, breadth and 
depth — is prepared and filled with cow-dung cakes. A crucible containing 
the substance to be heated is kept covered in the middle of the heap of 
cakes. When the cakes are set fire to, the process of heating starts and 
lasts till all the cakes are reduced to ashes. In another pufa called gaja- 
putam, the cubical pit is of twenty-two and a half inches in length, breadth 
and depth. An eighteen-inch cubical pit is called vardhaputam, and a 
fifteen-inch one, kukkutaputam. In the place of cow-dung cakes, some- 
times husk is also used as a source of fire as in the case of bhdndapu(am. 
In special cases, solar heat is preferred (suryaputam).

Gold is incinerated by first rubbing it with mercury and lime juice, 
washing it with water and then rubbing with sulphur, and finally 
subjecting it to puta-paka fourteen times. Silver is incinerated by making 
it an amalgam (with mercury) and the lump thus obtained is rubbed with 
orpiment, sulphur and lime juice. The mass is then subjected to pu^a 
four times. In the case of copper, the method is more or less similar, 
only orpiment is not used and the incineration is carried out in a gajapufa 
three times. Iron is incinerated using the decoction of three myrobalans 
and heating it in the gajapufa at least sixty times. In the case of tin, 
the juice of human is the efficacious additive, and for lead and zinc, the juice of 
nirguruji. These are the general methods followed by the rasavadins^ and 
there are also variations in the practices adopted by some of them. 

The process of ‘killing (mdranaY a metal before it is used as a con- 
stituent of medicinal preparations deserves special mention. For this pur- 
pose, some salts, copper or iron pyrites, sulphur and plant extracts are used. 
The best method of ‘killing’ all the metals, according to the Rasaratna- 
samuccaya,^ is to heat them with the sulphide of mercury and, according to 
the Rasahrdayaj^ with iron pyrites and cinnabar. The ‘killed’ metal 
may generally be a sulphide. 

Gems are considered to be of special value in the ‘fixation’ of mercury 
and also in the preparation of compositions which increase memory and 
virile power. They are, with the exception of diamond, incinerated by 
rubbing them with sulphur, orpiment, realgar and the juice of lakuca, and 
subjecting to pufa eight times. The Rasaratnasamuccaya^ gives an elaborate 
process for the extraction of ‘liquid principle’ from the gems. Without 
a proper chemical analysis, it is very difficult to say what would be the 
chemical composition of this ‘liquid principle’ which is stated to be the 
‘essence’ of the gem. 

It will thus be seen that the Indian alchemists developed processes 
leading to different alchemical compositions which involve the use of a 
number of minerals, metals and gems, as also certain medicinal plants 
which were, by and large, naturally available in India. The details 
as given in the rasasastra texts concerning their classification, methods 
of purification and the like throw ample light on the fact that the Indian 
rasavadins must have arrived at them through protracted experimental 
methods over a long period. Further, different methods of purification, 
distillation, extraction of essences and similar other processes could not have 
been developed without sustained and systematic experimentation which 
involved the use of the apparatus of various types. This aspect is considered 
later.

use of a number of plants in different operations of alchemical and iatro-

chemical nature. The plants are even referred to as divyausadhi (divine 
medicinal plants). Generally their roots, leaves or seeds are used in diges- 
tion processes. Sometimes oils or exudates of certain plants are also 
employed. More than two hundred names of plants are mentioned in 
different texts on Rasa^astra and it is rather difficult to give a complete 
description of all of them in this short survey. The following is a brief

The Indian rasavadins believed that the minerals and metals would 
not acquire the desirable iatro-chemical properties unless they were treated 
or digested with one medicinal plant or the other. Even mercury, ex- 
tolled as divine, should undergo this process. As the Matrkabhedatantram

emphatically says: ‘mercury cannot be reduced to bhasma without the

THE LABORATORY 

An estimate of alchemy in India is incomplete without a proper ac- 
count of the systematic procedures and operations which the Indian al- 
chemists adopted in their pursuit of the Elixir of Life as well as the trans- 
mutation of the base metals into gold or silver. Even though alchemy 
was a common belief among a large section of people in medieval India, 
the alchemical practices were confined to a limited section of the popula- 
tion. The reason was that the rigours of the faith were as mysterious 
as they were exacting. Honesty, self-control, sincerity of purpose and, 
above all, fear of God were considered as very essential for those engaged 
in the performance of various operations. Besides they were also required 
to be well versed in the knowledge of minerals and herbs. The mediocres 
and the dishonest, the quacks and the charlatans could not therefore 
take to this profession. Instead, the obedient and the faithful who were 
properly initiated into the secrets of mercurial science of the twenty- 
seven celebrated alchemists (Adima, Candrasena, Laiikesa, Vi§arada, KapalT, 
Matta, Mandavya, Bhaskara, Surasenaka, Ratnako^a, Sambhu, Sattvika, 
Naravahana, Indrada, Gomukha, Kambali, Vyadi, Nagarjuna, Surananda, 
Nagabodhi, Ya^odhana, Khanda, Kapalika, Brahma, Govinda, Lampaka 
and Hari, as mentioned in the Rasaratnasamuccaya),^ who were the custodians 
of the rasavldya in India, were alone qualified to pursue alchemical practices. 
In the course of initiation it was enjoined that the ‘science of mercury’ 
should be kept a closely guarded secret because it was feared that its efficacy 
would vanish if divulged to the uninitiated. 

The alchemists had their laboratories (rasasdla) too. According to 
the Rasaratnasamuccaya: ‘The laboratory is to be erected in a place rich 
in medicinal herbs. It should be spacious, furnished with four doors and 
decorated with the portraits of divine beings. It should have several types 
of apparatus or contrivances. The phallus of mercury (rasalinga) in the 
east, furnaces in the south-east, instruments in the south-west, washing 
operations in the west, and drying operations in the north-west— these and 
other ingredients necessary for alchemical operations should be installed 
with chantings. There should be the Kosthi apparatus (for extraction of 
essences) pair of bellows, pestle and mortar, sieves of varying degrees of 
fineness, earthen material for the crucibles, dried cow-dung cakes for 
heating purposes, retorts of glass, iron pans, conch-shells, etc.’® 

The rasaMd or the ‘House of mercury and other rasas^ was a place 
where the devoted would carry out diverse operations under the benign 
influence of the rasalinga^ a symbol of esoteric potentiality, which was either 
a gold amalgam prepared by rubbing gold and mercury (three parts of gold

and nine parts of mercuiy) or a cx)nipound of mercury and sulphur, shaped 
into a linga. The latter has a special significance. The preparation of this 
type of rasalinga has been dealt with in the tantrik text, the Matrkabheda- 
tantram, in which Siva tells Devi that mercury is his seed (bfja), sulphur 
her own principle (svapuspa) and that the rasalinga is to be prepared with 
these two constituents. The process consists in intimately mixing mercury 
with the extract of jhin^i (Barberia cristata) and constantly stirring (without 
rubbing) till it assumes the consistency of mud. Then the mixture is 
shaped into the linga form and, with the powder of sulphur placed all over 
the surface, heated slightly over the fire of charcoal or cow-dung. The 
process is repeated till the linga, now called the rasalinga, becomes hard. 
The Rasalinga undoubtedly represents a tantrik imagery envisaging a male- 
female polarity at the divine level, corresponding to the tantrik vision of the 
highest which is non-dual. In fact, the union of mercury and sulphur 
in the form of rasalinga is the non-dual Supreme.® 

APPARATUS 

A number of apparatus and appliances called yantras were employed 
by the rasavadins. The crucible, musd yantra, was predominantly earthen. 
To prepare the crucibles, earth of ant-hill, rice husk, iron rust, chalk, 
human hair and a few other ingredients should be compounded and 
rubbed together in goat’s milk so as to form a dough-like mass which would 
then be shaped into the desirable forms, and sun-dried. There were various 
types of crucible for different operations. For the extraction of zinc from 
calamine, ‘a crucible of the shape of brinjal {Solanum melongena) to which 
is attached a tubular end which expands towards its mouth like a flower’ 
was generally used. For heating mercury and sulphur together, the following 
details of a mu^d yantra are given in the Rasdrnava:^ ‘The apparatus consists 
of two crucibles, each twelve digits in length; one of them has a narrow 
orifice. In this is to be taken sulphur, and mercury in the other. Mercury 
and sulphur are to be moistened with filtered garlic juice. The sulphur 
containing crucible is to be inserted into the one having mercury, and 
the apparatus carefully lowered into an earthen pot over which another 
earthen pot is to be kept, and the rims luted with cloth. It is heated from 
outside by cow-dung fire for three days.’ Of the other types of crucibles, 
mention may be made of the gostanJmusd^ (crucible of the shape of udder 
of cow, used for liquefying substances) and the pakka musd^ (a pot-type 
used for roasting purposes). 

In addition to the musd yantra, the other types of apparatus men- 
tioned include:] kosfhi yantram, dold yantram, svedanl yantram, different types 
of pdtana yantram, dJpikd yantram, (jlheki yantram, jdrana yantram, garbha

An attempt is made to give a brief account of some of the important 
apparatus. 

The kos^hi apparatus consists of two suitable vessels (one of them being 
bigger) measuring sixteen digits in width and two cubits in length, and 
both of them having rims on two sides. ‘Swooned’ mercury is to be 
placed in the bigger vessel and heated with sour gruel from outside by the 
application of cow-dung fire from below. 



In the dold yantram, the substance is kept in a piece of cloth, tied and 
suspended by means of a rod which is placed across a pot half-filled with the 
desired liquid. The substance is kept immersed in the liquid. The liquid 
is then heated from outside. The svedanJ yantram is used for steaming 
purposes. The mouth of a pot is covered with a piece of cloth and the 
substance to be steamed is placed on the cloth. Water is kept in the pot 
and this is again covered by means of another pot. The substance is 
steamed by boiling the water. 

The pdtana yantram, which is employed for purposes of sublimation 
or distillation, consists of a well-baked pot of suitable dimension. Water 
is taken in this pot to its neck. Over this pot is kept inverted another big 
pot. The junction of the two necks of the pots is kept tight by the appli- 
cation of a dough made of lime, raw sugar and buffalo’s milk. The inside 
bottom of the upper vessel is smeared with the substance and it is heated

from outside by burning cow-dung cakes. The vapours of the substance 
fall into the water of the lower one, i.e. sublimation is directed downwards 
(adhahpdtam). When necessary, the substance is also heated in the lower

pot and the upper one is kept cooled by applying wet rags. The sublimate 
deposits in the interior of the upper pot, i.e. the sublimation is directed 
upwards {urdhvapatana). There is also a variant of this procedure. A pot 
or a vessel is provided with a long tube fitted in an inclined position, which 
is in communication with inside of another vessel. The latter serves as 
the receiver. The substance kept in the former is heated when the vapours 
condense in the receiver which is kept cooled (tiryakpdtana). 

In another apparatus called the 4heki yantram, a hole is made slightly 
below the neck of a pot and one end of a bamboo tube is introduced into 
it. The other end is fitted into a brass vessel which is filled with water.

Mercury mixed with the other desired substances is subjected to distilla- 
tion in this type of apparatus. The extraction of mercury from cinnabar 
is carried out in an apparatus styled the vidyadhara yantram. For this 
purpose, two pots are placed one above the other. The upper one contains 
cold water and the lower one containing cinnabar is heated. 



Fig . 5 . 1 7 . The tiryak pat ana yantram. 


The vdluka yantram is of the type of a sand-bath for heating substances 
uniformly and for usually a long time. A long necked bottle, containing 
the substance to be heated, is kept buried in sand in an earthen pot up 
to three-fourths of its height. The apparatus is heated from below for 
a long time till a straw, when placed on the surface of the sand, catches 
fire. Instead of sand, sometimes a salt is used, and the apparatus is then 
called the lavana yantram. 

Fumigation of the leaves of gold or silver with the fumes of sulphur 
or arsenic substances is done in another type of apparatus called dhupa 
yantram. Two vessels are employed for this purpose. In the lower vessel, 
iron bars are placed in a slanting position below its mouth, and leaves 
of gold or silver are placed on them. Sulphur or the arsenic substance is 
placed in the lower vessel and the other vessel is used for covering purposes. 
On heating, the fumigation takes place. In the ndlika yantram, which is 
more or less of the type of the lavana yantram, only an iron tube {nalikd) is 
substituted for the glass bottle. The bhudhara yantram is a simple closed 
crucible which contains the desired chemical substance and is kept inside a 
mass of sand. It is heated from outside by burning cow-dung cakes. 

The apparatus, it should be noted, are simple and purposeful. Generally 
they are of earthen material shaped into different forms; but apparatus made 
of crude glass was also used. The source of heat, either cow-dung or wood, 
could not yield high temperature. However, the maximum effect of heating 

was sought to be attained by heating the substances for a long period 

from hours to days and weeks.

INDIAN ALCHEMY AND lATRO-CHEMISTRY 

Though, as stated before, alchemy appeared late on the Indian scene, 
it seems to have registered rapid growth. Perhaps in one respect it was 
far ahead. It seems that in India the use of alchemy for bringing succour 
to the disease-afflicted humanity was recognized by the rasavddins much 
earlier than the iatro-chemists of the west led by Paracelsus (a.d. 1490-1541). 
The Indian alchemical texts of even the eleventh or twelfth century a.d. 
contain details of a number of compositions to be used as medicines for 
curing specific diseases. The reason is not far to seek. Alchemy in India 
was concerned more with the life-prolonging processes than with the 
conversion of base metals into noble ones. 

However, one important difference between the iatro-chemists of the 
west and those of India cannot be overlooked. In the west, the iatro- 
chemists, in particular Paracelsus, thought that the human body was to 
be recognized as a chemical system comprising mercury, sulphur and salt. 
It was further recognized that an imbalance among the three would give 
rise to diseased states. The third principle ‘salt’ was introduced by Para- 
celsus in addition to the already well-known two principles, viz. sulphur 
and mercury, of the alchemists. This is the famous triaprima of Para- 
celsus.® The theory of Paracelsus ran counter to the four humoral theory 
of the Greeks, of Galen (a.d. 131-201) and Avicenna (c. a.d. 980-1037) 
who were admittedly the two great authorities on medicine in their 
times. In fact, Paracelsus propounded his theory by burning in public 
the books of Galen and Avicenna who never considered the human body 
in chemical terms. The ideas and demonstrations of Paracelsus acted as 
a stimulus to accept the view that the human body, composed as it is of 
mineral substances, could, in times of diseased states, be cured by the use 
of mineral medicines. This eventually pointed to the superiority of the 
mineral medicines over the herbal ones. According to Paracelsus, alchemy 
was to engage itself in the noble task of transforming the naturally occur- 
ring minerals into products which would prove beneficial to humanity. There 
came about a view that the diseases were highly specific and, for each such 
disease, a chemical cure of equal specificity should be found out. Al- 
chemical operations were to be designed towards that end. As against 
these views, it must be emphasized, the alchemists of India thought of the 
human body in terms of tantrik elements. 

In its earlier state, the Indian rasavidya unlike the Ayurveda did not 
accept the paHcabhuta theory or the doctrine of the five elements. At a 
later stage, however, the postulate that mercury, the principal alchemical 
element, was itself composed of five elements, gained support. Further, 
the trido^a theory which characterizes the Ayurveda also came under its 
purview. In course of time the efficacies of mercury-based medicines were 
even sought to be formulated in the light of the pahcabhuta theory, parti- 
cularly by the Siddha system of medicine in Tamilnadu. 


• Mason, pp. 60-65. 



CHEMICAL PRACTICES AND ALCHEMY 


335 


In the history of alchemy in India there is still one thread of thought 
which has not been pursued critically. The Siddha system of medicine 
and practice, mostly followed in Tamilnadu, is known to have mercury- 
based alchemical ideas relating to longevity. The names of Agastya and 
Bogar have been mentioned already as the authors of a number of works in 
Tamil. The writings of Bogar contain a number of references to his con- 
tacts with China. Whether he was a Chinese who imparted alchemical 
knowledge to the Tamilians is a moot point. The Tamilians themselves 
think of Bogar as having taught alchemy to the Chinese. They believe that 
one Thirumular was the originator of the Siddha system. But the date of 
Thirumular has not been established beyond doubt. While tradition places 
him at about 3000 b.c., the historical evidence assigns to him (Thirumula- 
nayanmar) a date between the sixth and seventh centuries a.d.® The name 
of Agastya is another which is of doubtful authorship as well as date. 
There appears to be no doubt, however, that the Siddha system recognizes 
the tantrik elements. Eighteen Siddhas are generally recognized and of 
them Agastya and Bogar are the most celebrated. Bogar is stated to have 
resided on Palni Hills and the disc of mysterious triangles of tantrik sig- 
nificance, which is now there, is attributed to him. In addition, the way 
the literature on the Siddha system speaks of kundalinl, the cakras, yogic 
concentration, nada, bindu and the use of mystic letters shows the marked 
influence of tantrik ideas on this system. 

However, there appears to be one important difference between the 
alchemical ideas found in the Sanskrit texts and those in the Tamil works. 
In the Tamilian alchemy, a prime substance known as muppu occupies an 
important place. Muppu is considered to be the union of three salts, viz. 
puniru (possibly a mixture of carbonates), kalluppu (rock salt) and andakkal 
(probably calcium carbonate). Four types of muppu are recognized: 
vada muppu, vaidya muppu, yoga muppu and jhdna muppu. The first type 
is used in the Tamilian alchemy, the second in the Siddha system of medicine, 
the third and fourth seem to connote their effect on spiritual practices. 
While the Tamil texts attribute even supernatural powers to muppu, the 
Sanskrit works on alchemy do not speak of muppu at all. 

It would appear that the Tamilian muppu corresponds to the later 
European concept of the Philosopher’s stone, for muppu is presumed to 
possess an extraordinary potency of transmuting baser metals into gold 
as well as rejuvenating the human system. Even though mercury is given a 
special place in the Siddha system, the former is believed to acquire the 
desired potency only by the use of muppu. In this respect, muppu is also 
referred to as guru (the venerable leader) or guruphaspam. The vada muppu 
appears to have in it the compounds (possibly the two chlorides) of 
mercury.

But, to be effective and miraculous, the Tamilian tradition has it that 
muppu should have as its most efficacious ingredient puniru of very high 
quality. Even to this day, the practitioners of the Siddha system of medicine 
and believers in alchemy go out in search of puniru of the best quality. 
According to the tradition again, there are some 35 places in south India 



Fig. 5. 1 8. An efflorescence of puniru ; (inset) art{iakkal.^ 

where puniru could be obtained. Kalahasti, Thiru Alankadu (near 
Madras), Sivagahga, Pasumalai, Vada Madurai, Dindigal, Thillaivanam, 
Tenkasi and Cape Comorin are considered to be among the best places for 
procuring puniru. The word puniru seems to be an outlandish form of 
bhu-nir or water or exudation from the earth. 

® The sketch is based on the photograph taken on 2 April 1969 at Thiru Alankadu, a place 
about 40 miles west of Madras, which the author visited for observing the efflorescence 
between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. when the fullmoon was low on the western sky. The Siddha 
Vaidya Dr. T. K. Sivarao accompanied him and gave a practical demonstration of the 
traditional ways of collecting, grading and later purifying puniru, in accordance with 
the well-known texts of the Siddha systems. 


CHEMICAL PRACTICES AND ALCHEMY

Puniru of the desired quality comes out as an efflorescence (white fluid) 
from a soil rich in the fuller’s earth in these areas during the four full 
moon nights in the misty months of January, February, March and April. 
The soil itself is considered in terms of male and female or bindu and nddam 
respectively depending upon its appearance, the former being greyish and 
yielding andakkal, and the latter light grey in appearance. The male- 
female symbolism is pronounced in the Tamilian alchemy. The principal 
alchemical substances are even categorized into dnn (male) and penn 
(female). As in the Sanskrit texts, mercury is considered male and sulphur 
female. 

Pmlru is supposed to be in the nature of male-female union. Accord- 
ing to the traditional explanation, puniru is formed by the action of the 
rays of the full moon (male) on the earth (female) at certain places. The 
earth is said to give birth to puniru. The watery portion found along 
with the exudation of puniru is called amuri which is supposed to have 
special medicinal value. 

On one of the full moon nights stated above and at selected places, 
full grown puniru efflorescence comes up (about an inch in height) 
and it is collected towards the dawn when the moon is low on the western 
sky. The top white fluid is carefully taken out, and this is said to be the 
puniru of the first quality. The bottom portion along with the sand is 
also scraped off, and this is considered to be an inferior variety. About 
a foot below the efflorescence is found the andakkal which is dug out. 
Andakkal, also called Bramhakkal, is egg-shaped and generally brownish 
or whitish, depending upon the soil. 

There seem to be a number of methods of preparing muppu, and these 
methods are kept as closely guarded secrets by the practitioners of the 
Siddha vaidya and alchemy. The three components, viz. puniru, kalluppu 
and andakkal, are subjected to several processes of purification before they 
are transformed into muppu. A process involving the use of a potent 
liquid called muppujeynir, consisting of muppu, ammonium chloride, 
chlorides of mercury and sodium chloride, is regarded as of fundamental 
importance in the Tamilian alchemy. Another liquid called kafijalam 
(probably rice gruel) is supposed to be a fluid of great potency even to 
‘kill’ all minerals and metals. The gruel itself is obtained after an elabo- 
rate process by prolonged exposure to rays of the sun and moon for a period 
of six months.® 

There are two more important aspects of the Tamilian alchemy which 
deserve special mention. The alchemical substances, minerals and metals, 
are invariably subjected to complex processes of calcination and the like in 
order to obtain what are called bhaspams, cendurams and cunnams. Prepared 
with meticulous care, these constitute different steps even in the transmuta- 
tion of metals.*' The other aspect relates to the use of symbolic expressions

for denoting the alchemical substances and processes themselves. In the 
Sanskrit texts also are found such expressions which go by the name of 
sandhya bhasa (intentional language).® The Tamilian symbolic expressions 
seem to be quite considerable calling for detailed study. 

As stated already, the Sanskrit texts give an account of the use of plants 
in the transmutation processes. The Tamil works also describe similar uses 
involving different types of plants. The Agattiyarcarakku speaks of transmu- 
tation processes with reference to a number of herbs. Thus, for example, it is 
stated that the juicy vetpanai{Wrigutia tinctoria) is employed in the alchemical 
process of converting iron into higher metals; the withered kalthdmarai 
(a mountainous plant) is used in processing copper into a higher metal; 
vanni {Prosopis spicigord) aids transmutation of iron into copper; thanninvittan 
kilangu {Asparagus racemosus) is employed in the alchemical processing of 
copper; marudani {Lawsonia alba) and nirarali (Polygonum barbatum) help 
in the transmutation of iron into copper; serandu pavai (an unidentified 
herb) is used in the alchemical process of transmuting iron into copper; 
semmaram (Soymeda febrifuga) can be used in the process of transmuting 
copper into gold; singaththarai (an unidentified herb) enables transmutation 
of iron into gold. 

The Tamil texts, which possibly derived inspiration from the Sanskrit 
sources, appear to deal with certain drug compositions with specific 
drug actions even outside the pale of alchemy. This is not to suggest that 
the compositions were totally devoid of undertones of esoteric nature. 
Nevertheless, there is a significant improvement in the matter of alchemical 
practices designed towards medicinal formulations for human benefit. A 
detailed study of Tamil texts relating to the Siddha system is essential for 
understanding the growth and movement of alchemical as well as iatro- 
chemical ideas and practices in India. 


CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY IN MEDIEVAL INDIA 

In the medieval period while the alchemical thought and practice were 
in the nature of an excursus into the realm of tantrik ideals followed by 
certain groups of people in some parts of the country, there were many 
noteworthy chemical techniques which were flourishing at the same time. 
In this survey particular mention should be made of metal-casting and 
paper-making. The former found new aesthetic and utilitarian forms and 
the latter made its d^but into India in this period. 

Metal-working 

The metal-smiths in the central, eastern and southern parts of India 
evolved intricate forms of both copper and bronZe images, which were 
fashioned hollow and solid castings on a large scale by the well-known

cite perdue process. A number of bronze images of the Buddha have 
been recently found in the ruins of a monastery at Sirpur in Madhya Pradesh, 
and they belong to the ninth-eleventh centuries a.d. The icon-workman- 
ship of metal-smiths in Bengal had considerable influence on the metal- 
working in Nepal and Tibet.® In south India, during the Chola period 
(ninth to thirteenth centuries) the cire perdue solid casting method was 
generally in vogue. Metal icons were fabricated according to canonically 
correct ornamentation and in attractive style, aesthetically erecting several 
figures even on one pedestal. 

In this period there came out certain valuable literary works which give 
details of the icon-making methods. Among them the Manasollasa or 
Abhilasitarthacintanmni attributed to the King Somesvara Bhulokamalla of 
the Chalukya Dynasty in the Karnataka area, written in the twelfth 
century a.d., has given a very clear account of the icon-casting process 
as follows: 

‘According to the navatdla^ measurement, as mentioned before, the 
expert should first prepare the image (i.e. the model) complete with all its 
limbs, yellowish in colour, beautiful to look at, and with the weapons and 
arms as prescribed.’ 

After placing the wax lubes of the length of a dhatura flower on the 
back, on the shoulders and on the neck or the crown (of the image), (the 
artist) should besmear the image with refined clay. 

To clay should be added charred husk, finely rubbed and cotton severed 
a hundred times and a little finely powdered salt. All these (when mixed 
with clay) should be ground on a smooth stone and (the paste) should be 
applied three times all over (the image). 

The first layer (of clay) should be transparent (and thin) and dried 
in the shade. After a couple of days a second layer should again (be 
applied). When dry again, there should be the third coating thickly applied. 

(One) should besmear the whole (image or model) with clay leaving 
the mouths of the tubes open; and the wise man should dry it (the clay 
coating) with care and judgement. The expert should first (i.e. before 
beginning the process just mentioned) measure the wax of the image which 
has to be made either in brass, or copper, or silver or gold. 

Brass and copper should be taken ten times that of wax, silver twelve 
times, and gold sixteen. 

(Then one) should encase the metal, either gold or one that is desired, 
with clay and coconut-shaped crucible (thus formed) should be dried 
in the aforesaid manner. 

Next, (one) should melt away the wax (from the mould) by heating 
(the mould) in fire and should afterwards heat the crucible in cinders. 


“ Reeves, p. 23. 

According to this, the entire length of an image is nine times the height of the face, 
which is generally nine inches ; the length of the image is divided into 108 equal parts 
which are proportionately distributed over the different limbs (Acharya, p. 297). 



340 


A CONCISE HISIORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


Brass and copper melt surely with (the help of) cinders just kindled. 
Silver melts with (the help of) glowing cinders, while gold with (the help of) 
cinders flaming fivefold. 

After making a hole with an iron, on the top of the crucible and holding 
it tightly with a pair of tongs, (one) should pour molten metal into the 
mouth of the tube in a continuous stream and stop when it is filled to the 
brim of the tube. 

The adjacent fire should be put out for the purpose of cooling (the 
mould with the molten metal). When the image gets cooled naturally, 
the expert should break the clay very carefully. 

Then the metal image verily resembles that in wax, endowed with 
similar limbs and other details.® 

The icons of the medieval period were indeed noted for their exquisite 
forms and lasting metallic lustre. The icon production, which was a 
flourishing mctal-art particularly in south India, went hand in hand with 
the building of imposing temples in increasing numbers. The Vijayanagar 
empire was noted for brisk trade in a wide variety of bronze objects. 

Iron smelting and forging operations were also followed with further 
achievements. In the temples at Puri and Konark in Orissa are found a 
number of iron beams. There are as many as 239 iron beams (up to 17' 
long and 6"x4'' or 5*'x6'' in section) in the garden temple (also 
called Gunduchiburi) at Puri. The Konark temple contains beams (29 in 
number) of even larger dimensions (18'-35' long and about one foot 
square). A chemical analysis of these beams shows that they are made 
of wrought iron (iron: 99-64%; manganese: nil; carbon and 
sulphur: traces; and phosphorous: 0*15%; specific gravity: 7-8) more 
or less similar in composition to that of the Iron Pillar at 
Delhi,* The probable date of these beams may be about 
the twelfth century a.d. The Iron Pillar at Dhar (ancient capital of Malwa) 
is another notable vestige of the medieval period. It is of a much larger 
size than the Iron Pillar at Delhi, its total length being 43' 8". To quote 
Vincent Smith: ‘whilst we marvel at the skill shown by the ancient arti- 
ficers in forging a great mass of the Delhi Pillar, we must give a still greater 
measure of admiration to the forgotten craftsmen who dealt so success- 
fully in producing the still more ponderous iron mass of the Dhar Pillar 
monument with its length of (over) 42 ft.’^^ The Dhar Pillar is now lying 
broken in three pieces; the largest being 24' 3" and square in section. 
Perhaps the fourth piece is missing. The weight of the pillar is estimated 
to be about seven tons. While the local tradition maintains that the pillar 
has been made of the saptadhatus (seven metals), the chemical analysis shows 
that the pillar is made of wrought iron like the Delhi Pillar. As Neogi puts 
it, ‘it must not be forgotten that the Dhar Pillar in its completed con- 
dition would be the biggest iron pillar in the whole world.’** The date 
of this pillar is believed to be about the twelfth century a.d. Another

iron pillar, probably belonging to the fifteenth century A.D., is that in the 
temple of Achale^war on Mount Abu in Rajasthan. It is 12' 9" high with 
a iSaiva trident on its top. The foregoing achievements amply illustrate 
how skilful and imaginative were the metal-smiths in India. 

In the medieval period, there were many centres famed for making the 
damascened swords, i.e. those on the surface of which certain patterns like 
swirls, water ripples and the like are fashioned. Obviously steel of high 
quality must have been used for making these swords. The blades were 
etched probably by using some chemicals about which practically no 
information is available. A microscopic examination of these blades has 
revealed the dexterity with which the damascene pattern was given to the 
steel before forging it into blade form. Indian damascened swords were in 
great demand in foreign countries. 

In the Moghul period, there were metallic guns of large dimensions 
made of bronze and iron. The great gun of Agra (made of brass; weight: 
over 53 tons; length 14' and bore 22^") and MalikA-maidan (made of 
bronze; copper: 80*4%; tin: 19-53%; length: 14' 3"; diameter: 4' 10" at 
mouth; 2' 4|" at bore; probably cast in Ahmednagar and now in Bijapur) 
deserve special notice. It is believed that the latter was the largest of its 
type in the world then. The sixteenth century a.d. was specially noted for 
the production of guns, although it would seem that guns were in use 
in India even in the fifteenth century a.d. Iron guns of bigger dimensions 
were also in use, particularly in eastern India, the maximum length of a gun 
noticed being 31', and weight about 47 tons. One of the iron guns observed 
at Dacca (now lost probably in floods) weighed about 30 tons, and the iron 
ball which it contained had a weight of about 465 pounds.® 

paper manufacture 

While the metal-working had established itself in different parts of the 
country as an important craft flourishing under indigenous influences, the art 
of paper-making was introduced into India by about the eleventh century 
A.D., probably from Nepal which in turn might have obtained the technique 
of paper production from China. It would also appear that some parts of 
India, specially western India, obtained the knowledge of paper-making 
through the Arabs.*' It seems to be fairly certain that the Chinese 
knew the method of paper-making as early as the second century b.c. 
It is believed that one Ts’ai-lun invented the method of producing paper 
and offered his production as a present to the King in a.d. 105. There 
is no doubt that the Arabs learnt the process of paper-making from the 
Chinese, and towards the close of the eighth century a.d., Samarqand 
and Baghdad had paper factories. By the tenth century a.d. Samarqand 
had established a reputation for itself for the production of different types 
of paper.

A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


Before the introduction of paper into India, the ancient literature was 
preserved generally on palm-leaves {tala patra) in south India and birch bark 
(bhurja patra) in Kashmir and northern regions of the country. But paper 
began to be used considerably in the fourteenth or fifteenth century a.d. 
And in the later half of the fifteenth century, Kashmir was producing paper 
of attractive quality from the pulp of rags and hemp with lime and soda 
added to whiten the pulp. The Kashmir paper even acquired the status 
of being an important article of present among the contemporary kings. 
There were other paper-producing centres in the Panjab (Sialkot), Oudh 
(Zafarabad), Bihar (Bihar town and Arwal), Bengal (Murshidabad and 
Hooghly), Gujarat (Ahmedabad), Aurangabad and Mysore. Sialkot 
produced paper of very high quality in brands such as ‘Mansinghi’, ‘Nimt- 
tariri’ and ‘Khasab-i-Jehangiri\ Zafarabad, also known as Kaghdishaher 
(paper city), used to manufacture glossy and strong paper from bamboo 
pulp, though it was somewhat brownish in appearance. Unpolished 
paper was also being produced there. Paper from Bihar centres was 
also very fine. Gujarat, which probably produced the largest quantity of 
paper in the late fifteenth and the early sixteenth centuries, even exported 
the Indian paper to the west Asian countries and Turkey. This paper 
was white, glossy and in all sizes, thick and thin, and in colours. In the 
Moghul period, Aurangabad developed into an important paper-producing 
centre and supplied paper to other parts of south India. During Tipu’s 
time, a paper-making factory was started in Mysore where a special type 
of paper having gold surface was produced by mixing the desired quantity 
of powdered gold into the pulp before sheeting. 

‘The technique of paper-making was more or less the same through- 
out the country differing, of course, only in the preparation of pulp from 
different materials. The skill of the Indian artisan streamlined the product 
to greater excellence. Generally the rags were thoroughly cleansed, boiled 
and beaten into a pulp with water to the consistency of cream. A finely 
woven wire sieve was dipped into the vat {data). A horizontal shaking 
motion was given to the sieve, which caused the fibres to felt or interlock, 
the water draining away through the fine holes in the sieve. The sheet 
was then placed between felt and subjected to pressure. After drying, 
the paper was dipped in size {mandi) to render it non-porous, and finally 
dried and smoothened by passing it through rollers under pressure. To 
size the paper and render it fit for ink, a glue, somewhat gelatinous, was 
first prepared in the vessel which contained this mixture, a rod was placed 
and a cleft stick used for holding the sheet of paper during the process 
of dipping. As soon as the paper had been sufficiently saturated, it was 
withdrawn by gently rolling it round the stick which had been laid over 
the vessel. The sheet of paper was afterwards hung to dry. It was then 
smoothened and polished by rubbing it on wood with the convex side of 
a chank-shell. Jute, sunn, ambaree, moorve, old sacks and fishing nets 
were also used as raw materials. Forbes Royle observes that the fibrous parts 
of many lily and aloe-leafed plants have been converted into excellent paper

in India, where the fibres of liliaceous, malvaceous and leguminous plants 
are employed for the same purpose.’® 

Another method of paper-making was as follows: ‘The materials 
employed were old clothes, old tents, the bark of certain shrubs and trees, 
etc. . . . These materials were beaten with a wooden hammer or dhenki, 
after having been washed well and soaked in water for several days. The 
pulp was mixed with a little water in a lime-lined (chunam) reservoir, 
where the beating operation was also carried out. The workmen dipped 
their moulds into the reservoir, and the mixture, when lifted out, instantly 
would become paper. It was then removed, and each sheet drawn through 
a second reservoir of water and then hung up to dry. A quantity of gum 
arabic was dissolved in water into which the beaten pulp was placed. The 
water in the second reservoir, througli which the sheets were drawn, also 
contained gum in the form of a mucilage, as well as some alum dissolved 
in it. The moulds or forms used by the workmen were generally made 
of bamboo. The gum (gum arabic) was obtained as an exudation from a 
tree, known commonly as the babool tree.’^ 

In the late medieval period paper manufacture received great en- 
couragement under the Peshwas, the main centres being Poona, Bijapur, 
Nasik and Erandol. A chemical analysis of the various kinds of paper 
of the medieval period has shown that they were principally made of cotton 
clothes (rags) and flax. Some of them were also made of wood pulp. 
The ash contents of these paper samples range from 4 to 9%. It would 
appear that starch or gum was being used for sizing purposes. 


COSMETICS AND PERFUMERY 

A reference has already been made to the knowledge and practical appli- 
cations concerning cosmetics and perfumery as contained in Varahamihira’s 
Brhatsamhita. In the medieval period, this industry registered consider- 
able progress, and new techniques and compositions were developed. 
Special texts, both in Sanskrit and in the other languages like Marathi 
and Kannada, dealing with perfumery and elegant methods of fragrant 
upkeep of the body, were also composed during this period. Of them, the 
Gandhasara of Gangadhara (eleventh or twelfth century a.d.) deserves 
mention.'’ The text gives six processes for the preparation of cosmetics 
as follows: bhavana (infusion of fragrant powders with the desired liquids), 
pacana (digestion of materials probably for curing purposes), bodha (tem- 
pering or intensifying the perfume), vedha (further intensification or ‘excita- 
tion’), dhupana (fumigation with aromatic incenses, vapours, etc.) and 
vasana (preparation of scents utilizing the perfumes of flowers). Details 
are given of the pacana process in terms of pufapaka, gartapaka, venupdka, 
doJapaka, kharparapdka, baijayuro and kdlapdka. These details throw

ample light on the experimental skill of the perfume-makers. Even to 
this day some of these processes are in vogue in different parts of the 
country. The qualitative and quantitative aspects of these processes merit 
particular attention as they governed the blending, curing or intensification 
of the perfumes. The Gandhasara mentions twenty-five types of fragrant 
water (gandhodaka) and also a number of fragrant aromatic substances 
such as pdrijdta, mukhavasa (perfume to make the breath fragrant), gandha- 
taila (scented oil), yallavdsa (dust of sandal and pollen of lotus in cold 
water), dhupa and varti (an unguent, eye salve, collyrium or any cosmetic 
in the form of a ball or pill). Further, the aromatic substances are classified 
into several vargas (categories) in the following way: 

(i) Pair a varga (leaves): tdlisapatra (Flacourtia cataphracta), jhula, 

rdmakarpura (a species of fragrant grass), pratdpa {Calotropis 
gigantea), tulasi (holy basil), murvd and damana; 

(ii) Puspa varga (flowers): lavafiga (cloves), mucukmda (Ptero- 

spermum suberifolium), campaka {Michelia campaka), sura- 
puspj, priyangu and sephdli; 

(iii) Phala varga (fruits): marlca (pepper), kankola, suksmaild (small 

cardamoms), jdiphala (nutmeg), renukd, haritaki {Terminalia 
chehula), dmalaki (Emblic myrobaJan), latdkasturl (Hibiscus 
moschatus) and the like; 

(iv) Tvag varga (bark): karpuratvak, lavangatvaky kharjurakausOy 

asokatvaky etc.; 

(v) Kd^tha varga (wood): candana (sandal), agaru (Agallochum), 

raktacandanay devaddru, etc.; 

(vi) Mula varga (roots): puskara mulay bhadramusta, gandhamustd 

and the like; 

(vii) Nirydsa varga (exudations): karpuray silhdrasa, guggnla, etc.; and 

(viii) Jlva varga (organic): kasturi (Hibiscus abelmoschus), mkhi 

( Unguis odoratus)y saydla, madhu (honey), etc. 

The Gandhavaday the authorship of which is not yet established beyond 
doubt, is another text (probably fourteenth or fifteenth century a.d.) on 
perfumery which has a commentary in Marathi of the other texts, the 
Agnipurdna (c. tenth century a.d.) contains recipes for scented oils. The 
utpalagandhi (lotus-scented saffron coloured oil) is, according to this text, 
prepared by intimately mixing equal quantities of cinnamon (tvac)y murd (a 
type of fragrant plant), Nardostachys jatamansi (nalada) and Andropagan 
(vdlaka)y and then blending the mixture with oil. Similar processes are 
given for the preparation of jasmine and other scented oils. 

There is no denying that India also received the knowledge of 
preparing some of the perfumes, from outside. The perfume, ambergris 
(ambara in Sanskrit), was introduced into India by the Arabs probably in 
the eighth or ninth century a.d. It was used as sugandhadravya or 
sugandhaka. It was also referred to as mdtsyika by virtue of the fact that 
this perfume is obtained from the entrails of the whales. Production of

rose water and the attar of roses, obtained from the petals of roses (for 
which Ghazipur in Uttar Pradesh is famous), was a well-known chemical 
practice in the medieval period. It would appear that the rose itself was 
introduced into India from Persia through the Arabs, and that the method 
of extracting attar (Arabic word: itr meaning perfume) was discovered by 
the mother of Nurjehan in a.d. 1612. Ain-i-Akhari gives a detailed account 
of the use of rose water in the preparation of perfumes.® Akbar was fond 
of perfumes and Ain-i-Akbari speaks of the ‘Regulations of the Perfume 
Officer of Akbar’. The perfume industry received fillip as a result of the royal 
baths and the religious needs. In paticular, the royal baths were noted 
for an extravagant use of perfumes, both blended and natural, and this is 
borne out by the references found in the Manasolldsa of King Somesvara. 

GUNPOWDER AND PYROTECHNICS 

There is evidence to indicate that guns and gunpowder were in use 
in Bengal in the beginning of the fifteenth century a.d. It is well known 
that at the beginning of the Moghul Period (sixteenth century a.d.) gun- 
powder became an article of warfare. The Sukranlti, a Sanskrit treatise 
attributed to Sukracarya, gives a description of how the gunpowder can be 
prepared using saltpetre, sulphur and charcoal in different ratios for use 
in different types of guns. One such composition, as stated in the text, con- 
sists of five parts of saltpetre, one part of sulphur and one part of charcoal, the 
last to be obtained from the arko, snuhi and other plants, cleaned and 
reduced to a fine powder. To the mixture is added the juice of the plants 
named above and, after thoroughly mixing, it is dried in the sun. It is 
finally ground into a powder which now becomes gunpowder.^ Agnicurm 
and naldstra are the names given to the gunpowder and gun respectively. 

Probably a century or two earlier, Indians possessed the knowledge 
of manufacturing specific fireworks, since the basic ingredients of the gun- 
powder constitute the components of mixtures used in the fireworks. By 
the seventeenth century a.d. fireworks became common in several parts 
of the country, particularly in Orissa, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamilnadu 
and Kerala. It is believed that the Indians obtained the knowledge of 
pyrotechnics from the Chinese who had certainly developed pyrotechnics 
even as early as the eleventh or twelfth century a.d. 

The literary sources dealing with gunpowder and pyrotechnics are in 
Sanskrit, Marathi, Tamil and Malayalam. Of the Sanskrit works, Kautuka- 
cintdmani by Gajapati Prataparudradeva of Orissa (fl. a.d. 1497-1539), 
Akdsabhairavakalpa (c. fifteenth century a.d.) and iSukraniti (c. sixteenth cen- 
tury A.D.) are important. Ekanatha’s Rukminisvyamvara (sixteenth century 
a.d.) and works of Ramadasa (seventeenth century a.d.) are the noted Marathi 
works, while BdnaBstram and Bogarsutiram are well known among the 
Tamil works. Vetikkampavidhi is a manual of fireworks in Malayalam

written by one Nilakantha who was also the reputed author of several 
works on Sanskrit literature. In addition, there is also a treatise on fire- 
works in Persian, by Zain-uI-AbidIn, the Muslim King of Kashmir (a.d. 
1420-70). 

The word *hana' in the sense of a rocket finds a place in the Sanskrit 
work of Prataparudradeva mentioned above. The authorship of the 
important works on pyrotechnics in Tamil is generally attributed to one 
Bogar or Boganathar who is among the eighteen Siddhas of Tamilnadu 
and who, according to the local tradition, had contacts with China. The 
Tamil works on pyrotechnics describe three principal types of fireworks, 
viz. those which pierce through air (rockets), those which produce sparks 
of coloured fire, and those which blaze with various colours and end with 
explosions. Saltpetre, sulphur, charcoal, iron powder, bamboo tubes 
and flats, mercury, cinnabar, copper salts, camphor, rice paste, arsenic 
substances, pulp of castor seeds and wicks are among the important 
ingredients mentioned in these works for the preparation of different fire- 
works. Several formulae, 98 in number, for the manufacture of some 
20 types of fireworks, are found in considerable detail in these Tamil sources. 
Of particular significance is the fact that the metal dusts (of copper, iron 
or steel, lead, brass and zinc) are used for producing sparklings of different 
colours. The dale of the works attributed to Bogar is uncertain. On 
the basis of some internal evidence found in the text, its probable date is 
twelfth to thirteenth centuries a.d. 

Spectacular display of fireworks was a common feature in marriages 
and other ceremonies in medieval India. In the fifteenth century a.d., 
various kinds of fireworks were displayed at Vijayanagar during festivals. 
Even foreign travellers like Barbosa in the sixteenth century a.d. have 
given vivid descriptions of the display of fireworks in certain parts of 
India. Bernier has given an account of 'bonnes' in warfare and how 
they used to be thrown against the enemy as a sort of grenade attached 
to a stick, and cherkys" thrown to explode with a view to separating 
fighting elephants. 


CONCLUSION 

The foregoing are some of the important technological practices in- 
volving the application of chemical knowledge. Though in the medieval 
period certain technological practices came to India from neighbouring 
countries, the Indian craftsmen acquired mastery over them soon and even 
made innovations in course of time. The Indian products like metalware, 
paper, cosmetics and dyestuffs found preference in foreign markets. There 
is no doubt that the technicians of medieval India brought to bear their 
aesthetic sense, too, upon some of their innovations. 

Historically, in the West, it was only in the last two or three decades 
of the eighteenth century that chemistry was placed on a solid foundation.

CHEMICAL PRACTICES AND ALCHEMY 


347 


Quantitative experiments were conducted systematically to study the 
nature of gases like carbon dioxide, air, oxygen, etc. As noted already, 
Joesph Black (1728-90), Henry Cavendish (1713-1810), Joseph Priestley 
(1733-1804) and Lavoiser (1743-94) were pioneers in the field of experi- 
mentation and methodical interpretation of the observed facts. However, 
about a century earlier, chemical problems attracted the attention of 
some leading men of science particularly in England and France, who 
courageously attempted to offer new explanations of certain phenomena. 
For instance, they discarded the vitalistic view which was then prevalent, 
viz. that the inorganic substances were alive, undergoing change as a result 
of the inner vital forces. Instead, they suggested that external mechanical 
forces act as instruments of change. This mechanical interpretation was no 
less responsible for placing the chemical knowcldge on the right path in 
the latter half of the seventeenth century. 

At this time, the British scientist, Robert Boyle, stressed the necessity 
of interpreting the observations of iatro-chemistry on the basis of the 
particles of matter and their motion. He advocated the atomic views for 
explaining such empirical observations as dissolution of salt in water, 
sulphur in oil or gold in mercury. Further, at that time it was Boyle who 
gave a precise definition of element as ‘certain primitive and simple, or 
perfectly unminglcd bodies; which not being made of any other bodies are 
the ingredients of which all those perfect bodies arc immediately com- 
pounded, and into which they are ultimately resolved’ {The Sceptical 
Chymist, 1661).^ Boyle’s approach to chemistry was a significant departure 
from that of either the iatro-chemists or of the alchemists. 

In India a mechanistic school of philosophy has been a conspicuous 
lacuna over a long period of time. It is true that different schools of Indian 
thought developed the atomic views. These could well have given birth to, 
and later strengthened a mechanical approach to the interpretation of 
the observed phenomena and the widely followed practices as well. But 
the atomism proved no more than a polemical ground. It only became 
the favourite thinking of the privileged intellectuals. 

In brief, it may be stated that the use of minerals, metallurgical 
practices and processing of common chemicals on the one hand and the 
craftsmanship associated with them on the other were no less pronounced 
in India than in the other well-known contemporaneous civilizations. It 
is no exaggeration to say that in certain technical exercises based on chemical 
knowledge, India had to its credit notable feats of excellence and out- 
standing achievements. But they did not receive any support or stimuli 
whatsoever from the thoughtful and privileged sections of the society. The 
practices remained more as useful arts than as branches of a developing 
chemical knowledge. As a result, the technical arts, though engendered 
from time to time by extraordinary skills and craftsmanship, began to show 
signs of decay for want of a proper conceptual framework.

As noted on pp. 326-27, a number of plants are used in the alchemical 
or iatro-chemical processes adopted by the rasavadins. The present state 
of knowledge on this subject does not permit yet a critical evaluation of 
the exact role of these plants vis-d-vis the processes associated with them. 
These plants are used for obtaining several herbal compositions which, 
in turn, are used as specific cures for certain diseases, by the Vaidyas even 
now. The following table gives a brief account of the principal chemical

AGRICULTURE 


S. P. Raychaudhuri 
Lallanji Gopal 
B. V. SUBBARAYAPPA 


The word ‘agriculture’ (agri = field; culture = tillage) means tillage of the 
soil leading to production of crops. The origin of agriculture could be 
traced to the early human attempts at settling down in congenial environ- 
ments and gradually exploiting the animal and plant resources which were 
found easily accessible. Undoubtedly, wild plants, their roots, fruits and 
seeds were among the principal plant resources belonging to the vegetable 
kingdom used as food by early man. In course of time it is natural to 
suppose that he must have gained a practical knowledge of their growth- 
characteristics, factors conducive to their rearing as well as reproduction, 
and their effect on the human system. There were indeed several steps 
between the necessity of gathering wild fruits, roots and seeds, and that of 
the regular cultivation of plants which produce them. When man began 
to lead a settled life, possibly being assured of an adequate supply of wild 
plant products some of which he could also store for a reasonable period, 
he was doubtless in a definite position to indulge in what may be called 
plant domestication even if it was on a small scale. The archaeological 
evidence indicates that in the old world the main area of such a domestica- 
tion of plants was the Near East which is sometimes referred to as the 
‘Fertile crescent’, and which included® Mesopotamia, eastern coast of the 
Mediterranean and the Nile valley. It is now known that by about the 
eighth or seventh millennium b.c., there were definite practices of plant 
domestication in the Near East although the beginnings of cultivation 
occurred at different periods in different places of the region. The digging 
stick and the hoe were the early contrivances of cultivation and the plough 
appears to have arrived on the scene by about the fourth millennium B.c. 
(probably in the eastern Mediterranean region) when agriculture became 
one of the most important productive enterprises.^

AGRICULTURE 


351 


In India, the history of agriculture begins with the practices of the 
inhabitants of the Indus Valley riparian culture. The fertile alluvial soil, 
rather a heavy monsoon rainfall at that time and the water of the Indus 
were conducive to the growth of a number of domesticated plants. As 
Marshall says: ‘Great cities with teeming populations like Mohenjo-daro 
and Harappa could never have come into being save in a country which 
was capable of producing food on a big scale, and where the presence of 
a great river made transport, irrigation and trade easy.’" Indeed the 
economy of the people of the Indus Valley Civilization was based on agri- 
cultural produce, which was quite substantial, although it would appear 
that, when compared with that of Mesopotamia, it was noticeably less. 
As regards the agricultural implements, they did not know the use of 
plough, but had only toothed harrow as may be inferred from one of the 
Indus ideograms.^ They, however, knew the technique of flood-irrigation. 

It has been surmised that a certain jar-type of pottery (called ‘scored 
pottery’) might have been used by the farmers of Mohenjo-daro as an 
appliance for raising water in a manner similar to that of the wheel used 
in most parts of the Near and Middle East even now. The specimens 
found at the Mohenjo-daro have deep grooves suggestive of the possibility 
of their being lashed to a wheel. The base and the rim of this type of 
pottery are also of shapes suitable to the operation of taking out water. 
However, in view of the fact that a number of these have been found near 
small public wells, it has been doubted whether they were used for obtaining 
a constant stream of water. Mackay says: ‘It is more than probable that 
some arrangement for drawing water for irrigation, by means of an end- 
less rope working on a wheel, with pottery vessels attached to it at intervals, 
was in use in Sind and other parts of Western India from very early times* 
though it may not have taken the form of the modern wheel. The latter 
may have been an improvement introduced into India from Persia. 
The use of the so-called Persian wheel is almost exclusively confined 
to Baluchistan, Sind and the Panjab, and some parts of the Bombay 
Presidency.’ 

The intensive excavations at Kalibangan, one of the important pre- 
Harappan sites in Rajasthan, have laid bare a furrowed field showing that 
even in the third millennium b.c. the technique of agriculture was of a 
sufficiently developed type. 

The querns found in the excavations show how the grinding of the 
grain was done on an extensive scale. Agriculture in those days mainly 
comprised cultivation of wheat, barley, sesamum, peas, cotton, date-palm, 
pomegranate and banana. It is indeed interesting to note that at Mohenjo- 
daro the wheat unearthed {Triticum sphaerococcum or Triticum compactum) 
belongs to a group which is still cultivated in the region of modern 
Panjab.'*

A CONCISI: HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


THE VEDIC PERIOD 

In the Vcdic period agriculture was an important vocation and the 
agricultural practices had social and religious undertones even. Domestic 
{grhya) rites and festivals then, as now, often synchronized with the four 
main agricultural operations of ploughing, sowing, reaping and threshing.® 
Some of the grhya rites also implied the need for maintaining cattle in 
abundance. That the Vedic people attached great importance to agri- 
culture can be very well understood by the reference made to it in the several 
hymns. A Rgvedic hymn says: ‘With the master of the field, our friend, 
we triumph; may he bestow upon us cattle, horses, nourishrnent, for by 
such (gifts) he makes us happy ... May the herbs (of the field) be sweet 
for us; may the heavens, the waters, the firmament be kind to us; may the 
lord of the field be gracious to us . . . May the oxen (draw) happily; the 
men (labour) happily; the plough furrow happily . . . Auspicious ’ Sita 
(furrow), be present, we glorify thee; that thou mayst be propitious to us, 
that thou mayst yield us abundant fruit ... May the ploughshares break 
upon land happily; may the ploughman go happily with the oxen; may 
Parjanya (water the earth) with sweet showers happily Similar ideas 
are expressed in the Atharvaveda^ which has also a number of hymns which 
are in the nature of invocation to the god of plenty, of rain and of cattle 
with a view to getting good harvests and cattle wealth. These reveal that 
the agricultural practice was regarded as one of noble occupations. 

The Vedic word used to denote agriculture is krsi which literally means 
the act of ploughing, the produce being called sasya. The Ftgvedic terms 
like yavani kys and sasya have their identities with the expressions yao karesh 
and hahya in the Avesla, indicating a possible relation between the agricul- 
tural practices of the Vedic India and those of Iran. The agricultural 
implements mentioned in the Vedic literature include the plough {Imgala,^ 
phala* Sira) and sitd) and datra/ srni.'' Lahgak was of a lace-pointed 
type, having a smooth handle, while slra was a large and heavy one. Sieve 
{titau) was in use to separate the grain from the straw, and winnowing 
{iurpd) was resorted to. Vrdara* was the vessel used for measuring the grain. 

Plough {Jdhgala) was used extensively, drawn by oxen in teams of six, 
eight or even twelve, and repeated ploughing^ was resorted to with a view 
to enabling the soil to acquire the desired quality. The ploughland was 
called urvara or ksetra. Cow-dung (sakyt) was used as manure and the dried 
cow-dung (kari^a) was found to be better. The Kafhaka Sarrihita describes 
a process of cultivation as well as harvesting using the plough and sickle* 
respectively. Agriculture was considered by the Vedic people as one of

reproduction in much the same way as human procreation, as the Atharva- 
veda says: ‘Scatter the seeds in the prepared ground (yoni)*^ 

Of the important grains grown during the Vedic period, viz. wheat, 
rice and barley, it is significant to note that the figveda does not mention 
rice at all. Obviously, then, rice was a wild growth and not yet cultivated 
in the area in which the figveda was compiled.** It began to be grown at 
a later time as evidenced by the reference to rice in the TaittirlyaP and the 
Kd(haka Saiphitds,^ and the Atharvaveda/ The term used for rice of 
good quality is tandulaj vrihi^ and id//,* and for the wild variety, nlvdra. 
The Taittiriya even refers to the husked (karna) and unhusked (akarm) 
rice.* 

The Vedic farmers knew the method of improving the fertility of the 
soil by what may be called the method of rotation. As the Taittiriya 
Samhitd mentions, ‘rotation of crops’ might have been practised inasmuch 
as rice would be sown in summer and pulses in winter on the same 
field.^ According to Roxburgh, the Father of Indian Botany, ‘the Western 
World is to be indebted to India for this system of sowing’.* Generally, 
in the Vedic period two harvests a year were gathered. The common 
domesticated animals were bull, oxen, sheep, goat* and cow. The cow, 
in particular, was held in high veneration and it even symbolized the 
mother earth. A Rgvedic hymn extols the importance of cow.*** 

The number of references pertaining to agriculture as found in the 
Vedic literature bring home to us that the cultivator in the Vedic period 
possessed a fair knowledge of the fertility of the land, selection and treat- 
ment of seeds, seasons of sowing and harvesting, rotation and other cul- 
tural practices of crops, manuring for increased production of crops, and 
the like. 

As regards irrigation, the Rgvedic farmers had realized the importance 
of constructing channels for carrying water from wells and probably from 
rivers even. In view of the climatic conditions such as the none-too-heavy 
annual rainfall, dry air and high temperatures during summer, which would 
not be conducive to the storage of water, it was not possible to have tanks 
and other artificial reservoirs, particularly in the Panjab. The principle of 
collecting water from catchment hilly areas of undulating surface and 
carrying it through canals to distant areas was also known to the farmers 
of the Vedic period. Of the water-lifting devices, the ftgveda^ mentions 
one by the name aimacakra which was, as the name suggests, a wheel

made of stone; and water was raised, with the help of the wheel, in a pail 
using a leather strap." Yet another device is referred to as dronay which 
was a sloop. There was also a ghafayantra^ or udghafema which was of 
the type of a drum-shaped wheel round which went a pair of endless ropes 
with ghafa or earthen pots tied to them at equal distances. The technical 
details of all these devices are, however, still unavailable. 

THE POST-VEDIC PERIOD 

In the post-Vedic period, the political unification which was brought 
about by the monarchs of Magadha contributed a great deal to the develop- 
ment of agriculture. It must be emphasized that the State then had an 
established machinery for collecting taxes from its subjects who followed 
different vocations, the principal ones which provided the people with the 
means of livelihood being krsi (agriculture), pahpalana (cattle-tending) and 
vdnijya (trade). The three together were recognized as vdrttd (derived 
from vrttiy meaning livelihood). The most important of the three voca- 
tions was, as could be expected, agriculture. The rural economy was based 
upon the grdma-ksetra (the arable land of the village) which was cultivated 
not unoften by means of co-operative irrigation. There were also large 
holdings— estates of 1,000 karlsas (probably acres) or even more and one 
which required for its cultivation as many as 500 ploughs and a number of 
hired labourers to ply the ploughs with their oxen.^ 

The Arthasdstra of Kau^ilya contains information of value to the 
understanding of importance of agriculture in those days. Undoubtedly, 
the State gave considerable encouragement to the settlement of people on 
unoccupied (§myanivesaY land with a view to not only providing them 
with employment but also increasing the agricultural production. It also 
supported the construction as well as maintenance of irrigation works and 
was vigilant so as to ensure continued tilling of the lands,® making the act 
of keeping the fertile land uncultivated, a punishable offence. 

In this period there was an increasing awareness of the agricultural 
properties of the land. With the accumulated experience, it had become 
possible to classify lands and make attempts to utilize the suitable ones 
effectively. The land, according to Kautilya, consisted of krsta (cultivated), 
ak^s^a (uncultivated), sthala (high and dry ground), keddra (field sown 
with crops), drama (grovel), sanda (horticultural plantations), mulavdpa 
(field for growing roots), vdta (sugar-cane plantations), vana (forest), vmta 
(pasture land) and pathi (roads).'^ 

There was yet another type of land classification from a different 
standpoint. The growth of medicinal herbs, certain varieties of rice, pulses, 
oilseeds, etc., which were used for efficient medical care, needed suitable

soil which would be conducive to their eflScacy. The two medical classics 
give details of the distinctive traits of different types of soil commended for 
the culture of medicinal herbs and certain grains. Su^ruta recommends a 
ground ‘which possesses a soil which is glossy, firm, black, yellowish or 
red and does not contain any sand, ash or any other alkaline substance, is 
permeable to the germination of seeds and easily pervious to the roots of 
plants growing thereon, and which is supplied with the necessary moisture 
from a nearby stream or reservoir of water’.® He divides the land into 
three categories, viz. jangaky anupa and sadhdrana, according to the geo- 
graphic and climatic conditions. Jdhgala is one which presents a flat sur- 
face and has scanty growth of thorny shrubs, isolated hills or knolls, where 
strong gales of warm wind blow and water gets drained. Anupa is a watery 
or swampy region with woods and forests, hilly and which is impassable 
owing to its network of rivers and sheets of accumulated water. Sddhdrana 
is midway between the two. A similar type of classification is found in the 
Caraka Samhitd.^ 

The Arthasdstra, which throws enough light on the state of agriculture 
possibly of its time, speaks of the science of agriculture and the Director of 
Agriculture® (Sitddhyaksa), The latter was expected to be conversant with 
the suitability of the soil, ploughing, preparation of the soil, selection of 
proper seeds, etc., on the one hand, and the amount of rainfall that was 
expected to occur in different seasons of the year on the other. The text 
says: ‘In conformity with that, he (the Director) should cause crops to be 
sown, requiring plenty or little water. *$a//.rice, vrlhi-ncc, kodrava^ sesa- 
mum, priyangUy ddraka and varaka (Phaseolus trilobus) are the first sowings. 
Mudga, mdsa and saimbya are the middle sowings. SafiSower, lentils, 
horse-gram, barley, wheat, kaldyUy linseed and mustard are the lasUowings 
. . . which should be in conformity with the season ... A (region) where 
the foam strikes (phendghdtah) the banks is suited for creeper fruits ; (regions 
on) the outskirts of overflows, for long pepper, grapes and sugar-cane; 
those on the borders of wells, for vegetables and roots, those on the borders 
of moist beds of lakes, for green grass . . .’ 

The Arthasdstra refers to the preparation of the field by ploughing 
three times {trm karsakdn) in heavy rains.^^ Often deep ploughing was 
done. The ploughshare which was fitted in the central bent portion (potra) 
of the plough was made of iron. 

According to this text, the seeds need treatment before sowing, keeping 
the seeds (rice, wheat, barley) in the dew (by night) and drying in the sun 
(by day) for a week would bestow on them the desirable qualities. The 
seeds of pulses were to be similarly treated for three to five days and nights. 
Honey, ghee, pig’s fat, cow’s dung, etc., were also used for treating different 
seeds. When sprouted, the seeds were fed with fresh acrid fish along with 
the milk of snuhi {Euphorbia antiquorum) plant. Though the text does not 
give details of the method of watering different plants, it significantly

asserts that ‘ the (farmers) shall pay a water-rate of one-fifth when lifted 
from rivers, lakes, tanks and wells’.® Irrigated cultivation has been classi- 
fied so as to include flower-gardens, fruit-orchards, vegetables, wet crop- 
fields and roots. 

Panini^ mentions a practical classification in terms of cultivated and 
uncultivated lands. The former was known as karsa and the latter included 
usara (waste land) and gocara (pasture). The fields were also classified on 
the basis of the crops grown (yraiheya where vrihi was raised; Mleya—Mi; 
mdsy a— boms; tilya — sesamum, etc.) and also the quantities of seed required 
for sowing {prasthika—^tXA sown with a prastha measure of seed; draunika— 
drona, etc.). 

There were three crops, one sown in the rainy season and collected in 
granary in Magha (January-February), another sown in autumn and col- 
lected in granary before Caitra (March-April) and the third sown in spring 
and stored by Jye^tha (May-June). Two or three crops in a year imply 
the knowledge of crop rotation. No doubt rotation of crops as a scientific 
method developed in modern times. Without implying that such a practice 
was consciously developed with the help of scientific observations, we may 
say that the knowledge of the requirements of different crops and the 
different harvest seasons may have led to a rudimentary form of crop 
rotation. But it must be added that the method had not come into general 
practice. The cultivator took advantage of the double or triple harvest 
system or kept the fields fallow depending on the wealth of his fields and 
as his resources permitted or his needs required. A passage in the Artha- 
idstra suggesting that for augmenting the finances, the administration could 
prevail upon the cultivators to raise a second crop indicates that the practice 
of keeping lands fallow was also resorted to in many cases. The sowing 
of mixed crops was also widely practised. Patanjali tells us that sesamum 
was sown with beans (main crop), and the ploughing was done according to 
the requirements of the main crop. The seeds of the minor crop used to 
be sown by scattering them here and there.® 

As a recognition of high position accorded to agriculture by the rulers 
as well as the people at large, the construction of tanks and other types of 
reservoirs was considered to be an act of religious merit even. Construc- 
tion of irrigation works was regarded as one of the most important welfare 
activities which the State was expected to provide. There are many in- 
scriptions testifying that the rulers honoured this responsibility with devo- 
tion. The Maurya monarchs took keen interest in the irrigation schemes. 
This is borne out by the account of Megasthenes** who speaks of a band of 
officers who ‘superintend the rivers, measure the land, as is done in Egypt, 
and inspect the sluices by which the water is let out from the main canals 
into their branches, so that everyone may have an equal supply of it*. An

Lake, was constructed by Pu§yagupta under Chandragupta Maurya and 
restored later by Tusa§pa, the Yavana governor of A^oka. The vast 
reservoir suffered a breach (420 cubits long and 75 cubits deep) in the 
second century a.d., owing to heavy flood and onrush of the rivers Suvar- 
narekha, Palasini, etc., and was repaired by the Parthian amatya 
who was the governor of Rudradaman, the §aka ruler of that time, at the 
latter’s personal cost.® There is no doubt that on this lake depended the 
prosperity of the people of that area for a long time. In western India the 
successors of Rudradaman continued the tradition of constructing tanhs. 

In the central and south India huge tanks of great engineering skill 
were constructed. The technical skill that went into the construction of 
these tanks is clear from the fact that some of them even now serve the 
purpose for which they were made. The pioneer work in this respect was 
done by Karikala I, who reigned towards the close of the first century a.d., 
when he tamed the river Kaveri by means of embankments for utilization 
of the water of the Kaveri through a number of canals. He also excavated 
tanks for the benefit of those parts of the kingdom which could not receive 
water from the river. In those days in south India there used to be tank 
sub-committees of the village assembly, which looked after the maintenance 
of tanks. 


CLASSICAL AGE AND LATER 

In the Classical Age and later, agriculture made great headway as 
indicated by the wide variety of agricultural products grown in different 
parts of the country, and also the royal encouragement given to irrigation 
works. The well-organized governments under the Guptas in the Gangetic 
basin, Malwa, Gujarat and Kathiawar, of the Vakatakas and Chalukyas 
in the Deccan and of the Pallavas in the south took keen interest in, and 
adopted concerted measures for, the development of agriculture, which led 
to increased agricultural produce and a flourishing trade in a number of 
agricultural products. The State had realized the importance of the culti- 
vation of waste lands {khila) and so offered liberal terms to the people to 
purchase them. Land-grants were also made by them on many occasions. 
The Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsang who visited India at this time gives an 
account of the agricultural as well as horticultural products grown in 
different regions, such as rice, wheat, ginger, mustard, tamarind, mango, 
melon, wood-apple, pear, plum, peach and apricot. He even speaks 
of a variety of rice produced at Po-li-ye-ta-lo (Pariyatra, i.e. Bairat) which 
ripened in 60 days.*’ There is no denying the fact that in the period under 
reference food-grains and fruits were being cultivated on an extensive scale 
in several parts of the country. A number of literary works of the period, 
including the encyclopaedic ones, allude directly or indirectly to the agri- 
cultural practice as well as the rich produce. While the encyclopaedic

A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


ones like the Amarako^a and the Brhatsamhitd have in them sections on 
certain aspects of agriculture, a specific text known as Pardiara deals 
entirely with agriculture. The contents of the latter may be taken to be 
as clearly indicative of the then existing knowledge and practice relating to 
agriculture, such as soil classification and land use, manuring, rotation of 
crops, irrigation, agricultural meteorology, tillage implements, protection 
of crops from diseases and pests, care of draught animal and grazing of 
cattle. The Krsi Pardsara asserts : ‘ . one taking to agriculture can become 
a sovereign monarch in the world. Rice is vitality, rice is vigour too, and 
rice (indeed) is the means of fulfilment of all the needs (of life). Gods, 
demons and human beings — ^all subsist on rice . . . Blessed is agriculture, 
holy agriculture and agriculture is the life of creatures . . . One furrow is 
conducive to victory, three are the givers of success and furrows numbering 
five give always crops.*® 

The text no doubt has portions relating to rites and ceremonies in 
association with various agricultural operations. Not infrequently super- 
stitious ideas, too, find expression in it. Nevertheless, it must be noted 
that religious practices of several descriptions were intricately woven into 
the social fabric of the ancient Indians and, as agriculture was the mainstay 
of the people, religious rites of superstitious nature were considered necessary 
in order to be successful in that operation which was, more often than 
naught, a gamble in rain. 

SOIL CLASSIFICATION AND LAND USE 

The suitability of different lands for the cultivation of different crops 
and herbs enumerated in the Artha§dstra and the medical classics respective- 
ly has been mentioned already. But the Amarako§a describes 12 types of 
land depending upon the fertility of the soil, irrigation and physical charac- 
teristics. The 12 types as mentioned in the Bhiimivarga^ of this lexicon 
are: urvard (fertile), usara (barren), maru (desert), aprahata (fallow), 
sddvala (grassy), pahkila (muddy), jalaprdyamanupa (watery), kaccha 
(land contiguous to water), ^arkard (land full of pebbles and pieces of lime- 
stone), ^arkardvati (sandy), mdfmdtrka (land watered from a river) and 
devarndt^ka (land watered by rain). In the VaUyavarga^ we are informed 
of the different kinds of soils particularly fit for the cultivation of different 
kinds of crops as follows: ksetram — rice and corn; yavya — barley; tailmam — 
sesamum; mawt/gwom— green gram, etc. There are also different names 
for lands ploughed once, twice and thrice, and at several stages. 

Use of Manure 

The Brhatsarphitd^ prescribes that seeds which have been properly 
treated are to be sown with the addition of pork or venison into the soil

(where previously sesame crop was raised, dug up and trodden) and sprin- 
kled daily with water mixed with milk (k^ira). It says further:® ‘To promote 
inflorescence and fructiflcation, a mixture of one a(jlhaka (64 palas) of 
sesame, 2 d(fhakas of excreta of goats or sheep, one prastha (16 palas) of 
barley powder, one told of beef thrown into one drona (256 palas) of water 
and standing over seven nights should be poured round the roots of the 
plant.* In order to ensure sprouting and growth of luxurious stem and 
foliage, according to the BrhatsamhitdJ^ the seed should be soaked in an 
infusion made of paddy powder, urad {mdsa)y sesame and barley which are 
mixed with decomposing flesh and the whole mass steamed with the addition 
of turmeric Qiaridrd). For the growth of kapittha (Feronia elephantum)^ the 
seeds should be soaked for a short time in a decoction of dsphota {Jasmine), 
dmalaki {Phyllanthus embellicus), dhava (Grislea tomentosa), vdsaka {Justica 
adhatoda), vetula (Calamus rotung), suryavalli (Gynandropsis pentaphyta), 
sydmd (Echites fructescens) and atimuktaka (Aganosma caryophyllata) boiled 
in milk. The soaked seeds should be dried in the sun and the process 
is to be repeated for a month. A circular hole is to be made in the ground 
(1 cubit in diameter and 2 cubits in depth), and the milky decoction poured 
into it. When it dries up, it is burnt and pasted over with ashes mixed 
with ghee and honey. Three inches of soil should now be thrown into 
them along with the powder of bean, sesame and barley, and then again 
three inches of soil. Finally, washings of flsh are to be sprinkled and the 
mud beaten to a thick consistency. Now the treated seeds should be 
placed in the hole.® 

According to the Agnipurdna,^ ‘a tree becomes laden with flowers and 
fruits by manuring the soil with powdered barley, sesamum and the oflfal 
matter of a goat mixed together and soaked in washings of beef for seven 
consecutive nights. A good growth of these is secured by sprinkling the 
washings of flsh on them*. 

The Krsi Pardsara says: ‘In the month of Mdgha a dung heap is to be 
raised with the help of a spade. When it becomes dried in the sun, smaller 
balls are made out of it. In the month of Phdlgma, the dried balls are 
placed into holes dug for the purpose in the fleld, and at the time of sowing 
they are scattered into the fleld.’® The practice of not disturbing the dung 
heap for a month means the minimization of the loss of nitrogen, the chief 
fertilizing element, that of drying into balls results in the reduction of active 
ammonia which may be injurious to the plants, while that of placing the 
dung balls into pits increases the humus which undoubtedly contributes to 
the fertility of the soil. 

The use of flesh of animals, flsh-washings, vegetable products and the 
farm-yard manure consisting of the excreta of various animals, mixed with 
litter which would absorb the animal urine, indicates that the farmers of the 
ancient period were well aware of their fertilizing property and also the

physical effects of the manure upon the texture and water-holding power 
of the soil, although they did not certainly possess the precise chemical 
knowledge of these fertilizers. It is now known that the farm-yard manure 
contains all the essential plant nutrients, viz. nitrogen, phosphoric acid and 
potash. It is obvious that the knowledge of manuring in those early days 
was apparently the result of extensive practical observations and not based 
on the laboratory observations of the modern type. 

Agricultural Implements and Accessories 

The Amarakola lists a number of agricultural implements such as 
plough (Idhgala, halo), pin of yoke (yugakflakaX shaft of the plough (Idngala- 
danda), goad (prdjana, todana), harrow {kotisa), spade or hoe {khanitraX 
sickle (datra, lavitraX tie for fastening the yoke to the plough {yotraX post 
for threshing grain on the floor (medhiX winnowing basket (surpa^ pras- 
phofana) and sieve (cdlanX titau).^ But it is in the Krsi Pardsara that we 
find a detailed description of the plough. According to this text the plough 
consists of the following parts:* Yuga (yoke), add^<:ada (pins of the yoke), 
fsa (pole of the plough), niryola (rod of the plough exclusive of the pole 
and the ploughshare), ^aula (an extra piece of wood that tightly fixes the 
niryola to the pole), niryolapdsikd (plates), halasthdm (strong piece of wood 
fixed to the niryola at the end opposite to where the ploughshare is fixed), 
paccanl (goad made of bamboo with iron top), abandha (iron rod which 
prevents niryola from getting out of the pole, yoktra (tie) and phdla (plough- 
share). The text also gives dimensions of some of the parts in terms of 
plough. 

In addition, details are also given of ^rnJ (sickle), khanitra (hoe), musala 
(pestle), udukhala (mortar), iflrpa (winnowing basket), dhanyakft (winnow- 
ing fan), cdlani (sieve) and methi (threshing post). 

Irrigation 

As already noted, one of the types of land went under the appelation 
nadi-mdtrka which depended on irrigation utilizing the river water. There 
is enough evidence to indicate that due recognition was given to irrigation, 
both natural and artificial. The former channelled the water of the rivers 
and the monsoons in the northern and north-eastern parts of India 
respectively and the latter which utilized the stored water in tanks, pools 
and wells was adopted in the central, north-western and southern parts 
of India. 

The Ndradasmrti states that the erection of dyke in the middle of 
another man’s field is not prohibited in view of the fact that it would be 
advantageous for irrigation purposes, while the loss is trifling. It states 
further that a man with the permission of the owner can® restore a decayed 
dyke although without the owner’s consent he cannot use it. NSrada

classifies the dykes into kheyd (which is dug into the soil to drain off excess 
water) and bandhya (which is constructed to prevent the water from flowing 
out).® 

The State evinced keen interest in the upkeep of irrigation works and 
even framed rules for their proper functioning. A large number of canals 
were constructed with a view to not only carrying the water from the rivers 
or tanks but also preventing the lands from being inundated by swollen 
rivers. Rightly, therefore, the Amarakosa refers to the canals as drains 
(Jalanirgamah).^ In the eighth century a.d. King Lalitaditya of Kashmir got 
constructed a series of water-wheels to distribute the seasonal flood waters 
of the Vitasta and the Mahapadma lakes to various villages and this resulted 
in the irrigation of the fields. Later in the ninth century, during the 
reign of Avantivarman, his minister Surya constructed a number of dams 
and irrigation canals which enabled the country to possess abundant agri- 
cultural produce.® 

Reference has been made already to the Sudar^ana Lake. When this 
lake burst again due to heavy rainfall, Cakrapalita, who was the governor 
of the region, reconstructed it after two months’ effort involving huge 
expenditure. The embankment made was 100 cubits in length, 68 cubits 
in breadth and seven-man height (about 312 cubits). 

Crops 

In the Gupta period there were three harvests— summer, autumnal 
and vernal crops— as mentioned in the Brhatsarnhitd^ The seeds sown in 
summer would be duly reaped in Srdvam (early part of autumn) and the 
harvest was known as autumn crops. The grains sown in autumn yielded 
vernal crops and those sown in early spring gave the summer crops in 
Caitra or Vaisdkha/ It is reasonable to suppose that the first two crops 
were stable crops such as rice and wheat, and the last was of pulses, 
beans, etc. The rules of cultivation depending upon the season, rainfall, 
etc., had established themselves and the farmers had the necessary practical 
knowledge of engaging in agricultural operations leading to the production 
of a number of grains. A number of crops were grown during this period 
such as rice, wheat, barley, peas, lentil, pulses, spices and vegetables. 
Kalidasa in his Raghuvarnsa refers to paddy being grown in the fields of 
Bengal.^ The varieties of rice grown included sdli, kamald, nlvdra, uhccha- 
paddy and fyamaka-pdidAy, red rice, yellow rice and hog’s rice . . . Sdli- 
paddy was grown as transplantation and this means that the transplantation 
technique was known to the cultivators. Wheat was grown in the Panjab, 
Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, central India and Rajasthafi, as a rabi or winter crop 
and wherever possible through irrigation. Of the vegetables grown, the

Amarakoh mentions cucumber, onion, pumpkin and gourd. Sugar-cane 
was cultivated in the fields where rice used to be grown and harvested 
generally in winter. Cotton was grown mainly in Saura§htra or Kathiawar. 
The cultivation of silk-cotton, flax and hemp was also known. Pepper 
and cardamom were grown principally in the southern parts of India, 
particularly in the valleys of the modern Nilgiris. The other spices grown 
included mustard, cloves, ginger and turmeric. Saffron, betel-nut, tama- 
rind, sesamum, linseed, priyahgu, aloe, indigo, etc., were also raised. Of 
the number of fruits grown, mango was the most popular. Coconut was 
extensively used in the coastal areas of Bengal, Orissa and Madras. 

Treatment of Plant Diseases 

The Vrksayurveda of Surapala, which is believed to have been written 
by about the tenth century a.d., gives an interesting account of treating the 
plant diseases. The diseases of all trees are classified into two groups, viz. 
(i) those arising from the body, e.g. internal, and (ii) those attacking from 
outside. The bodily or internal diseases are said to arise from disorders 
of the wind {vdta)y phlegm (kapha) and bile (pitta), while the extraneous 
ailments are caused by vermin, frost, etc. To indicate some of the well- 
known methods of treatment mentioned in the text,** the relevant trans- 
lations of the Sanskrit portions are given below: 

‘One should cure the diseases of wind-disorders by the adminis- 
tration of flesh, lymph, fat and ghee. Nutriment provided by these 
substances removes all wind-troubles. 

Liberal fumigations with oils in which soap-berry, cow’s horn, 
horse’s hair, black pepper, ghee and porpoise have been boiled, and the 
lymph of a hog added, quickly remove the diseases of the wind. 

The trees are cured of bilious diseases by being watered with the 
decoctions of liquorice, honey and madhuka and with milk mixed with 
honey. 

All kinds of trees are relieved of bilious diseases if they are watered 
with the decoction (?) of the three myrobalans in which ghee and honey 
have been mixed. 

Insects are destroyed by the administration of water containing 
milk, carcass, \acd and cow-dung, and by the plaster prepared from 
white mustard, musta grass, vacd, ku^tha and ativia. 

Fumigation of the tree with the fumes of white mustard, rdmatha 
(?), vidahga, vacd, black pepper, beef, ambu (a kind of Andropogan), 
horn of buffalo and flesh of a pigeon, mixed with the powder of lodhra, 
at once destroys the colonies of insects infesting the trees. 

Plastering with vidahga mixed with ghee, irrigation with diluted 
milk for seven days and a poultice of beef, white mustard and sesamum 
are effective in destroying insects like kandara (?). 

" Manuscript, Oxford, No. 324 B (Mr. Walkar 137). available in the Bodleian Library, 
Oxford. 



AGRICULTURE 


363 


Injury caused by insects is healed by a plaster of \i4anga, sesamum, 
cow’s urine, ghee and white mustard and by watering with milk. 

The broken trees are (healed and) restored to health if their frac- 
tures are filled with fertile soil, plastered with (the powder of) the 
barks of plak?a and udumbara mixed with ghee, honey, wine and milk 
and then tightly tied with ropes and sprinkled with buffalo’s milk and, 
finally, watered copiously at the roots. 

The trees, whose branches have fallen off, would grow branches 
so abundantly that they would obstruct the view of the sky, if the 
broken ends of their branches are plastered with honey and ghee and 
they are watered with diluted milk and fumigated. 

Trees damaged by fire would cover the sky with foliage, if they 
are plastered all over with the paste of the lotus-plant and fed with 
carcass-water. 

Trees struck by lightning would bear beautiful leaves, if they are 
plastered with viddri, sugar, red arsenic and sesamum and watered 
with diluted milk.’ 


ANIMAL HUSBANDRY 

In the ancient period, a good deal of attention was paid to animal 
husbandry which included breeding, feeding and maintenance of domes- 
tic animals or livestock. Cows and bulls particularly received special 
treatment. The Brhaspati-smrti prescribes severe and cruel punish- 
ment for the theft of a cow.® The offender was made to lick a 
ploughshare made of iron having weight of 12 palas and healed 
to redness. If he was not burnt in this process, he would be set 
free. Bulls and bullocks which were employed widely as draught 
animals were looked after with great care. The Krsi Pardsara^ contains 
a number of rules of tending the cattle. Practically every village possessed 
common pasture and woodlands and places of drinking-water for the 
cattle. Cowsheds were always kept clean and the Krsi Pard^ara gives 
directions as to how the shed could be kept clean.® According to this text, 
a shed measuring five by five (?) is good for the healthy growth of cattle 
and ‘the washing of rice, hot scum of the boiled rice, fish broth, cotton 
seeds and husk, if kept in the cowshed, prove baneful to the cattle’. In- 
cidentally, this gives an idea of the fodder of the cattle at that time. ‘To 
safeguard against the breaking out of diseases, the shed should be occasion- 
ally fumigated with vapours of devaddru (Pinus deodara), vacd (oris root), 
mdrpsi (pulp of some fruits?), guggulu (a fragrant gum resin), hihg (asafoe- 
tida) and mustard seeds mixed together according to the Agnipurdna.^ The 
Visnudharmottara^ describes certain medical practices of treating the dis- 
eased cattle for curing their affected horn, ear, eyes, tooth, tongue, throat,

bladder, etc. The text says that oil in which the pounded mass of ginger, 
bafa and jafdmamsi has been cooked, and rock-salt and honey added, 
should be applied to the roots of the horns. The powder of the roots of 
wood-apple tree, apdmdrga, dhatakf, patala and kutaja when rubbed into 
gums removes toothache. Ginger, turmeric and the three myrobalans are 
indicated in the cure of sore-throat, and a certain prepared collyrium for 
the eyes. For the reunion of fractures, priyangu mixed with salt is recom- 
mended. The bilious disorders are stated to be cured by the administration 
of cow’s ghee in which liquorice has been cooked. Ailing calves should 
be made to drink pafhd stirred in butter-milk or turmeric dissolved in milk 
for the alleviation of their suffering. Oilcake in general was considered to 
be an elixir for the cattle. Salt is to be given to the cattle once in 15 days 
to prevent constipation, colic diseases and loss of appetite.® On the whole, 
animal husbandry was of sufficiently high order in the ancient period. 

In the ancient period, agriculture in India, though noted for its extensive 
and vigorous growth, was not entirely free from conventional practices 
which sometimes bordered on superstitions and astrological beliefs. Agri- 
cultural meteorology, for that matter, was undoubtedly based on conventional 
knowledge and a good deal of astrological calculations made inroads into it. 
The rainfall in different seasons of the year was sought to be correlated 
with the naksatras or lunar asterisms, and one of the planets was considered 
to be the presiding deity of the rainfall of the year. The commencement 
of the agricultural operation, worship of the plough and the animals, 
auspicious time for harvesting, etc., were conceived in terms of the prevail- 
ing planetary influences. Even now, this type of knowledge is current in 
most rural parts of the country. 

While considering agricultural practices in India in the ancient period, 
there is one important aspect which should not go unnoticed. India for 
ages has been known for its pithy sayings and proverbs which contain 
specialized information on various subjects in an epigrammatic style. These 
are in several Indian languages like Maithili, Tamil, Bengali and Hindi. 
Many a popular saying has been found in one of the manuscripts on 
Vfksdyurveda and in the Krsi Pard^ara enshrined in the Adyar Library, 
Madras. Some of these sayings are given below 

‘ Wheat should be sown in a somewhat dry field and barley in a 
wet field. If there is heavy rain, then chicken-pea should be sown. 

Maize, jowar and millet should be sown somewhat sparesely. 

Whosoever sows millet at the intervals of a step, and jowar at the 
intervals of frog’s leap, would be able to fill his barn with the crop. 

If the August-September (Bhadon) sowing of paddy be done in a 
field which has been well dug up and prepared (in the month of Jefh, 
i.e. May-June), then there would be plenty of rice-flakes (chinda) to 
enjoy.

A cultivator who sows according to the above proportion would 
be rewarded with double the crop. 

If there be moisture below (in the soil) and clouds above, then 
the veterans declare that gerui disease would be rampant. 

If the east wind blows during the month of Phdgun (February- 
March), then wheat crop would be infected with gerui. 

If the east wind blows in the months of Mdgha and Pans (December- 
January), then mustard would be eaten away by mohun (an insect). 

If the south wind blows, how it would be possible to taste the 
scum of boiled rice (for, there would be no harvest of paddy)? 

The gerui disease begins when the sun is in the sign of Aquarius 
(i.e. February-March) and disappears when it is in the sign of Pisces 
(March-April). It starts from the stalk and eats away the leaves. 

If wheat is infected with gerui and paddy with gandhi, then the 
cultivator would die of starvation (i.e. want of food-grains). 

If in the month of Mdgha (January-February) the colour of the 
cloud is red, then surely there would be a shower of hail-stones. 

If chicken-pea crop is chilled with cold, then it could be eaten 
away by the insect called gadhaita. 

If there is rainfall under the Citrd constellation, then the entire 
harvest would perish. 

Under the Maghd constellation the locusts thrive and under the

Jf there be rainfall at the rise of constellation Citrd and at the 
setting of Hastd, then the people would not complain howsoever 
heavily they may be taxed by the king. 

If the weather is not sufficiently cold in the month of Mdgha 
(January-February), then take it for granted, my friend, that food- 
grains would become dear (by their prices rising high). 

If the south wind blows during the months of Pans and Mdgha, 
then it is a good sign for (rainfall during) the month of Sdwan. 

If there is rainfall under the Maghd constellation, then all food- 
grains will have good crop. 

If the Hastd constellation wags its tail (i.e. sends showers just 
before setting), then the wheat would thrive without much effort.’ 

Agriculture as an avowed occupation of the countless Indian peasants 
flourished with centuries of experience and struggle against the natural 
oddity in the plains, the hilly tracts and in areas where semi-arid conditions 
prevailed. With passage of time cultivated areas were on the increase, 
more rivers harnessed for irrigation and more tanks, wells and other reser- 
voirs constructed. For in the ancient period, Indian economy was 
intimately interlocked with agriculture. 


THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD 

In the medieval period, the pattern of agricultural practices was more 
or less the same as that in early India, save for important changes which 
were evident in the introduction of new crops, trees as well as certain 
horticultural plants by the foreign traders and introduction of new land 
tenure system by the rulers during the period. The geographic distribution 
of the main food-crops was also more or less the same as we find it today. 
In respect of irrigation, newer efforts were made to construct canals of 
great length, and tanks, big and small, in great numbers, the former being 
noticeable particularly in the north-western part of India and the latter in 
south India. 

An account is given in the chapter on Botany of the principal crops, viz. 
wheat, rice, barley, millets, pulses, oilseeds, cotton and sugar-cane, and also 
some of the new plants introduced in this period. It may be noted that 
the cultivation of cotton was on the increase and that of sugar-cane more 
widespread in the Mughal times,® Bayona region was producing the best 
indigo, while Malwa and Bihar were known for the production of opium. 
On the Western Ghats, the cultivation of coffee plants had just begun in the 
seventeenth century, though the coffee seeds obtained were not of good

quality. Western Kashmir was famous for saffron and fruits, the Pandyan 
kingdom for ginger and cinnamon, Malabar for cardamom and the Malay 
hills (modern Ootacamund) for the fragrant sandalwood and Kerala, South 
Canara and Bengal for coconuts. In particular, Kerala was the land of 
the coconuts and by-products which with salt panned at the seashore paid 
for the major imports of cloth, metals and even grains. Out of the 
fibres of the nut ropes were made and used for binding the ships together 
and also as cables. The kernel found use not only as the main ingredient 
of a number of sweetmeats but also as a source of oil which was used, as 
it is now, for lighting purposes and as hair-oil. The other products in- 
cluded charcoal from shell, the trunk of the tree for construction of shelters 
and houses, fishing boats, etc. 

Of the new plants introduced in this period, the cashew (the nut) of 
South American origin was the most valuable as a money crop then as 
now. The cultivation of pineapple did not register significant progress, 
while the potato, guava and custard apple grew better outside Goa where 
they were introduced first by the Portuguese in the early sixteenth century. 
About A.D. 1550, the Jesuits of Goa introduced systematic mango-grafting, 
which improved the Indian fruit out of all recognition and created a further 
source of income for the horticulturists. Tobacco and chillies {capsicum) 
were also introduced in India in the latter half of the sixteenth century.® 

In respect of irrigation, wells, tanks and canals continued to be the 
principal means. In the Upper Gangetic plains and Dakhina^ wells were 
common. In the Panjab, arhat or rahat (Persian wheel) was used as a 
device for lifting water while in the Agra region the charas, a sort of a 
bucket made of leather, was used to lift water with the help of yoked oxen. 
At places where the water-table was rather high, denkli, which was based 
on the lever principle, was in use. In the south, tanks were constructed 
in increasing numbers. A Chola king built the Great Anicut (below the 
island of Srirangam across the river Kaveri) which was a huge dam con- 
structed out of unhewn stone, 1,080 feet long and 40-60 feet broad. ^ There 
was yet another tank at Porumamilla of greater dimensions — some 6,250 
yards long (slightly less than four miles), 83 yards in height and 10 yards 
broad or wide. This tank was completed in two years probably in the 
thirteenth century a.d. and we are informed by the Porumamilla tank 
inscription (a.d. 1291) that there were 1,000 labourers working every day 
and a fleet of 100 carts were pressed into service to bring the masonry 
material for the construction of the sluice and the dam. Tank-digging 
was considered to be one of the greatest meritorious acts in which the king 
and the people at large took abiding interest. The tank builders exhibited 
extraordinary skill not only in the construction of tanks but also in the 
restoration of breaches and distribution of excess of water from tank to tank 
in times of floods.** Wells were also in use for purposes of irrigation and

the water-lifting device employed was known as ettam, a type of pulley- 
wheel with a bucket suspended by rope and worked by hand. In south 
India the canals were relatively small. 

In areas near the sea such as Kerala and Goa, where the country 
consists of hilly land and the main food-producing soil lies at the bottom 
of the valley, it was recognized that to prevent water-logging the stream 
had to be allowed to flow at a rate that would keep the water-table high 
enough for the cultivation of rice, the only crop grown on such lands. It 
was also recognized that the salt water from the estuaries should not be 
allowed to enter at high tide, i.e. dykes must be kept in constant repair, 
and for this purpose strong flood gates were operated by one or more paid 
servants. Up some of the streams seasonal clay dykes were built for 
regulating the water-supply. The land at the bottom of the valley was 
held in common without fixed partition among the members of the agri- 
cultural community. The lower land was separated from the second level 
by rivetted embankments rising from three to ten feet. The hilltop land 
was generally held in common for grazing as well as for obtaining firewood. 
The rest of the land was assigned to the joint families for raising plantation 
crops. There were also plots for slash and burn cultivation on the sloping 
hillside. Flat patches on the hilltops provided naturally the soil for culti- 
vation as usual. It may be added that the salt and fish from the sea were 
mixed with plant ashes and used as fertilizer. 

In northern India, the eastern Jamuna canal® (which is erroneously 
attributed to Ali Mardan Khan) was constructed in the early part of the 
eighteenth century. Shahajahan constructed Nahr-i-Bihist or Shah Nahr— 
about 78 miles in length — to meet the water requirements of the new city 
of Shahajahanabad at Delhi. Yet another canal was constructed during 
the reign of Shahajahan, and that was from the Ravi at Raipur near the 
Siwalik hills, which carried water up to Lahore covering a distance of about 
84 miles. 

Seed-sowing Machine 

According to B. A. Keen, formerly Director of the Imperial Agricultural 
Research Institute at Pusa during 1930-31, India was a homeland of seed- 
sowing machines. He inclines to the view that the drilling of seeds was 
practised in India in the eighteenth century and probably earlier. Dr. 
Anderson of Fort St. George, Madras, remarks that this type of contrivance 
had been in use from time immemorial. It consisted of a wooden bowl with 
three or four tube outlets depositing seeds behind the coulters. The bowl 
was continuously replenished by hand. As there has been no change for 
years, identically the same type being in use today, it is reasonable to suppose 
that it was by no means a new contrivance which came on the scene towards 
the close of the eighteenth century (1796). In the U.K. although the

main practices in soil cultivation were well established by 1725, it was only 
in the first quarter of the eighteenth century that the first practicable im- 
plement for sowing of seeds in rows was invented there. This was the system 
of drilling seed in rows and horse-hoeing in between introduced by Jethro 
Tull. The first account of it appeared in 1731 in a book entitled New 
Horse-hoeing Husbandry or An Essay on the Principles of Tillage and Vege- 
tat ion, A more comprehensive treatise, Horse-hoeing Husbandry, was 
published in 1753, thirteen years after Tull’s death. It is, therefore, reason- 
able to assume that the seed-sowing machine of India was at least as old 
as that used in the U.K., if not earlier. 


ANIMAL HUSBANDRY 

In medieval India, cattle-breeding became one of the professions. While 
describing the former condition of cattle in India, the Indian Gazetteer 
made references to certain herdsmen as expert cattle-breeders who were 
conversant with the ways and means of skilfully tending cattle. Even up 
to recent times, these herdsmen existed in several parts of India, and it 
is to them that the Report of the Royal Commission on Agriculture (1928) 
attributes the fine breeds of cattle that are still found in many parts of the 
Panjab, Gujarat, Mysore, Ongole and Kangayam. 

That there has now been a general and all-round deterioration in the 
cattle-breeds of India requires no elaborate proof, and the causes are not 
far to seek. Medieval India had to pass through a series of foreign in- 
vasions and internal quarrels, and one of the results was that attention to the 
improvement of agriculture and animal welfare receded to the background. 
Decrease in the grazing area and the ignorance and poverty of the farmers 
were also two of the most important factors which have contributed to 
the present deteriorated condition of the cattle. 


STATE AND AGRICULTURE 

In Sher Shah’s reign, in every pargana the land was measured after 
every harvest and revenue collected according to the measurement. The 
crops of industrious farmers were protected from unnecessary injury by 
soldiers. During Akbar’s time, the cultivators were relieved of a number 
of taxations, supplementary taxes and fee by which even Hindu rulers had 
many a time raised the total amount of the land tax above the limit fixed 
by the constitutional law. The land was classified according to its soil 
and crop-bearing qualities. One-third of the average produce was collected 
as land revenue. The taxes were fixed in money value, but every ryot 
was allowed to pay in kind also, if he thought that the money rate was not 
fair and if the assessment of his land seemed to him too high, he had the 
right to insist upon the measurement and division of the crops. A rebate 
on the full demand was allowed in various cases, e.g. when the land had

suffered from floods or had been out of cultivation for three years. Further, 
the tax was remitted so long as the land lay fallow. The settlement was 
first made annually but afterwards for a period of 10 years on the basis of 
average payments for the preceding term. It is well known that the most 
important change introduced by Todar Mall was the one in the language 
and the character used in the revenue accounts to be written in Persian. 
Todar Mali’s bandobast or arrangement became a legend in northern India.

BOTANY 


PREHISTORIC PERIOD 
K. A. Chowdhury 


The prehistoric period is many times longer than the historic period. It is 
now believed that for about half a million years wandering men in small 
groups lived the life of food-gatherers, taking shelter sometimes in caves 
and at other limes leading a natural life in the open. It was during this 
period that stone tools were brought into use for the purpose of hunting. 
This period is known as the Old Stone Age. Some archaeologists believe 
that wood, a botanical product, was also used along with stone during this 
era, but actual evidence of use of wood is known only from the late Palaeo- 
lithic Age. At this time men of the Clactonian culture in England used yew- 
wood {Taxus baccatus L.) for spear. About the same time an entire spear 
of yew-wood, as Hawkes and Woolley have discussed, was found in Germany 
inside the skeleton of an elephant.® We can, therefore, say that the oldest 
record of use of botanical product is from upper palaeolithic era. 

India cannot claim the use of botanical products to such an early date. 
Here our oldest record is from the sites of Indus Valley civilization, in 
which cereals, woods and other plant products were used. Actual evidence 
of this sort in India is scanty and scattered and does not allow a chrono- 
logical history of the uses of plants. It has therefore been planned to give 
here the history of uses of cereals, cotton and wood alone. The other 
plant remains have to be kept aside for the time being. A profitable 
discussion on them will be possible when more data are available. 

CEREALS 


Wheat and Barley 

Among the cereals wheat and barley were recorded from Harappa 
and Mohenjo-daro. Association of these two cereals in the archaeological 
remains of Mesopotamia, along with other evidence, has led to the belief 


Hawkes and Woolley, p. 156. 



372 


A CX)NCISE fflSTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


that there was some contact between the Indus Valley and Mesopotamian 
(URS) civilizations. Here Helbaek’s opinion is interesting. He has 
pointed out that these two cereals have been cultivated together from 
the very beginning of village-farming in West Asia. Luthra has shown 
that the wheat recovered from Mohenjo-daro belongs to Triticum vulgare 
Vill. (T. aestivum L.) and T. compactum Host® and that from Harappa to 
T. compactum Host and 7. sphaerococcum Perciv. All these three types of 
wheat are now put under the Bread or Vulgare group by cytogeneticists.^ 
Archaeologists have advanced the hypothesis that wheat originated in 
South-West Asia and spread over to Europe and North Africa on the one 
side and to India on the other side via the trans-Caucasian region.*^ Con- 
firmation of this hypothesis is, however, still awaited. 

Interesting is also a recent find from western India. Two different 
types of wheat, namely Triticum vulgare-compactum and Triticum sp., have 
been reported by Mittre from the chalcolithic site of Navdatoli-Maheshwar. 
At present there is no evidence available to show wherefrom this wheat 
came. When this information is available through scientific investigations 
of the archaeological plant remains from places lying between those of the 
Indus Valley civilization and the afore-mentioned chalcolithic site, the 
significance of the wheat specimen found at the latter place will be 
realized. 

Barley from Mohenjo-daro and Harappa has yielded Hordeum vulgare 
var. nudum and H. vulgare var. hexastichum respectively. The cultivated 
barley is now classified under two main kinds — two-rowed and six-rowed. 
These are again grouped under smaller sub-groups based on other morpho- 
logical characters. Vavilov has suggested the possibility of its centre of 
origin in two places. Firstly, low-awned and hulled type from Ethiopia 
and North Africa and, secondly, short-awned, awnless, hullless and hooded 
type from China, Japan and Tibet. On the other hand, Helbaek holds 
the opinion that the origin of barley started with wild two-rowed hulled 
barley {H, spontaneum). The cultivated two-rowed barley, hulled and 
naked {H. distichum), directly came from it. From the latter the six-rowed 
types originated. The cultivated six-row, lax-eared, hulled and naked (H, 
tetrastichum), developed in the plains, while the six-row, dense-eared, hulled 
and naked (H, hexastichum^ originated in the mountain region. But the 
investigation by Chowdhury (K. A.) of remains of barley from Afghanistan 
does not fit into Helbaek’s scheme. It will therefore be seen that the 
origin of the cultivation of barley still remains to be worked out. When 
this is done we shall be in a position to say how Indian barley is related to it. 

Rice 

The origin of rice in India is no less obscure. Some are of the opinion 
that rice originated in China some 4,800 years ago and came to India later.

BOTANY

De Candolle did not believe it.® The earliest direct evidence of the use of 
rice in India, as shown by Chowdhury (K. A.), is from Hastinapur, near 
Meerut— a chalcolithic site (about 3,000 years old). At Hastinapur, only 
charred paddy was found but also the use of rice-husk as a binder for mud 
wall of houses. This has raised the possibility of the use of rice in north 
India much earlier than the age of Hastinapur indicates, because the use 
of a by-product comes to people when they have made use of the main 
natural product for a pretty long time. This interpretation is well sup- 
ported by two written documents. Firstly, rice is mentioned in the 
Atharvaveda. Secondly, ayurvedic literature written by Su^ruta recommends 
rice as cures for certain ailments. All these evidences strongly support 
the view that rice was used as food hundreds of years before 1000 b.c. 
Again, occurrences of rice-husk have recently been reported by Ghosh 
(S. S.) from Gujarat. The age is said to be 2000-1600 b.c. The sites were 
Lothal in Gujarat and Rangpur in Saurashtra. But Mittre has raised some 
doubt over this identification because of insufficient material available to 
Ghosh. It will therefore be judicious to be on the look-out for further 
evidence of rice from Harappan excavations before we can be sure that it 
was used as food at that time. Here Mittre’s report on rice from the 
chalcolithic site of Navdatoli-Maheshwar in western India is interesting. 
He identified these remains as Oryza sativa L. This is the first record of 
ancient rice from south India. We must await more such finds from this 
part of India before we attempt a profitable discussion on it. 

Ragi 

Sankalia and his co-workers*' have excavated a large number of pre- 
historic sites in south India. In course of their investigations they found 
out ragi {Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn.) at a site of 2(XX) B.c. The origin 
of ragi is said to be Indian. Many more sites of ancient ragi have to be 
located before we can confirm the belief that ragi originated in India. 

COTTON 

Cotton {Gossypium sp.), a commercially important plant product of 
the present century, can be traced back to Indus Valley civilization. From 
Mohenjo-daro, fragments of cotton cloth and string were recovered. Micro- 
scopic examination by Gulati and Turner of these fragments led to their 
identification as lint from G. arbor eum which is now extensively grown in 
India. Researches on the origin of old world cotton are interesting in this 
context. In 1947, Hutchinson, Silow and Stephens put forward the hypo- 
thesis that cultivated cotton arose in the Indus Valley but later Hutchinson^ 
has rejected it and suggested an alternative area in Africa. Much earlier, 
Watt^ pointed out that India derived some of its original stock of cotton

from Africa. Work in this direction is being continued. Recently a few 
cotton seeds with lint and fuzz have been discovered at an excavation at 
Nubia, Egypt. Microscopic examination has shown its resemblance to 
G. herbaceum group. From these facts it will be seen that much research 
will be necessary before the origin of present-day cotton is finally deter- 
mined. 

As regards written information on cotton, Brown® has drawn attention 
to its first reference in the Rgveda. Later, religious books of Manu also 
mention cotton. Greek writers, Herodotus and Theophrastus, report 
about cotton which comes from fruit of some wild trees in India. Indians 
not only grew cotton but also devised methods of ginning, spinning and 
weaving it into clothes. Despite the primitive nature of the gears, the final 
product was excellent and admired by foreigners who visited the country 
during early centuries. 


WOOD 

The oldest record of use of wood, in the Indian region, is from Harappa 
proper and from sites of Harappan culture in Gujarat. In the former 
two woods were found to have been used from a coffin, namely deodar 
(Cedrus deodara Loud.) and rosewood {Dalbergia latifolia Roxb.). Both 
are well known for the scent that they give off. Other wood remains found 
here and examined by Chowdhury and Ghosh (1) were used for a wooden 
mortar {Zizyphus mauritiana Lamk. Syn. Z. jujuba Lam. non Mill.) for 
pounding grains. Choice of these woods for specific purposes shows not 
only knowledge of where the trees grow but also of the characteristic 
qualities of the woods used. Here is a strong evidence to show that 
Harappan culture was based on years of experience on the use of this 
botanical product. The charred timbers recovered from Lothal in Gujarat 
and studied by Rao and Lai were Acacia sp., Albizzia sp., Tectona grandis 
L. f., Adina cordifolia (Roxb.), Benth. and Hook., Soymida febrifuge A. Juss. 
This is a clear indication that the Harappans knew of the quality of these 
timbers nearly as much as we know of them today. 

Of the old wood, special mention should be made of the two largest 
remains of wooden tools and implements which have been found at Burzhom 
in Kashmir and Chirand in Bihar, belonging to the neolithic complex of 
these sites. These remains indicate the various types of trees and plants 
which were used by the neolithic people of those areas. 

The other plant remains of later age are Dalbergia sissoo Roxb. 
and Holarrhena antidysenterica Wall, from Hastinapur, a chalcolithic 
site; these were used as firewoods (Chowdhury and Ghosh (3)). Near 
about the historic period (2,000 years) at Pataliputra a wooden pali- 
sade was put up as a protective measure against erosion by the River Ganges. 
The wood piles were of sal {Shorea robusta Gaertn.), one of the most

durable timbers in India, when used in contact with soil. The quality of 
the wood of the piles was estimated to be one of the best that sal can produce 
(Chowdhury and Ghosh (4)). For a gate at Sisupalgarh the timber used 
was Acacia sp. (Chowdhury and Ghosh (2)). An analysis of the use of 
all these wood remains invariably gives the impression that prehistoric 
men possessed sufficient sound knowledge of the properties of wood to 
make good use of them. 

Now coming to ancient literature, there are many instances of reference 
on the uses of wood. Occasionally, instructions regarding timbers to be 
used for various purposes were also given. When an analysis of these 
instructions is made, one gets the impression that basic knowledge on the 
seasoning properties of wood was available at that time. For the first 
time mention is also made of the craftsmen called vaddhaki who worked 
with wood. 

Thus it will be seen that the people of India had acquired a sound 
knowledge of the properties of wood and its efficient utilization even about 
5,000 years ago. If the people of Vedic Age can be credited with the 
practices of the rotation of agricultural crops, the credit of woodworking 
certainly belongs to a people of a much earlier age. 


THE VEDIC AND POST-VEDIC PERIOD 
A. K. Ghosh and S. N. Sen 

THE VEDIC PERIOD 

If the prehistoric period furnished evidence of the cultivation of cereals 
like wheat, barley, rice and ragi and of the use of woods of several varieties, 
it would be too natural to expect to find references to them in the literary 
records of the early historic period characterized by the composition of the 
Samhitds, the Brdhmanas and the Aranyakas-Upanisads. These records 
indeed bear ample testimony to the development of agriculture as an im- 
portant factor in the Vedic economy. The Rgveda has frequent references 
to the use of the plough, the sowing of seeds, the cutting of corn with the 
sickle, the threshing and winnowing of the corn, the practice of channel 
irrigation and the like. Agricultural pursuits definitely made further 
progress in the later phase of the Vedic culture as is evidenced by the use 
of larger and heavier plough, mention of several types of agricultural 
produce such as wheat, beans, corn, sesamum, extraction of oil from sesa- 
mum, relationship between seasons and the harvest, plant diseases and 
some attempt to deal v^dth them with magical spell. The growing ac- 
quaintance with plant life is further reflected in the appreciation of the 
medicinal properties of plants and in the appearance of a class of Atharvan 
priests specializing in the herbal treatment of diseases. Of no less im- 
portance is the diversification of the industrial life witnessed during this 



376 


A CX)NCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


period, in which a number of industries were clearly based on agriculture, 
e.g. basket-making, rope-making, dyeing, chariot-making, and so on. 

BOTANICAL KNOWLEDGE CONTAINED IN THE SAMHITaS, 
brAhmanas and upanisads 

What glimpse, if any, of the development of a kind of plant science 
do we obtain from such literary records as also from the bulk of the ritual- 
istic materials in which the Samhitas, the Brahmanas and the Aranyakas- 
Upanisads abound? The main difficulty lies in the scattered nature of the 
materials bearing on plants, as on several other matters of scientific interest, 
in these sacerdotal texts. Botany as a systematized branch of knowledge 
had not yet developed, and its evolution as a subject of specialized interest 
did not take place until after a much later date. Nevertheless, by arranging 
and regrouping these scattered materials under meaningful heads in which 
it is now customary to describe the plant science, it is possible to get a 
fair idea of the Vedic Indians regarding the morphology and internal 
structure of plants, their physiology and also whether at such distant date 
any attempt was made at their classification. 

As to morphology, different parts of a plant body such as the root, the 
shoot, stems, branches, leaves, flowers and fruits are distinguished and 
clearly named in the Samhitas, Brahmanas and Upanisads, The Rgveda 
uses the term skandha for the trunk or corona of the tree. The Taittirfya 
and the VajasaneyJ Samhitds enumerate the parts of a plant body as rniila 
(root), tula (shoot), kanda (stem), valia (twig), sakhd (branch), parna (leaf), 
puspa (flower) and phala (fruit).® In the well-known hymn of the Atharva- 
veda, dealing with medicinal plants, similar descriptions of plant bodies 
are met with.*" The plants are differently coloured— brown (babhru), white 
(^ukra), red {rohinl), black {kfsna\ spotted (prsni) and swarthy (asiknl). 
They are also of different types; some are of the spreading variety {pra- 
strnatl), some bushy (stambini), some jointed {kdndini)^ some rich in shoots 
(amhmati), some singly calyxed {eka-hhga\ some plants have spreading 
branches (viidkhd) and some by nature tend to extend (pratanvati). The 
different parts are referred to as follows: 

‘Honied are the roots of these herbs, honied their tops, honied 
their middles, honied their leaves, honied their blossoms . . .’ 

‘Those that have flowers, those that have blossoms, those that 
bear fruit and those that are without fruit . . 

It is futile to expect any detailed knowledge of the internal structure 
of plants, but some gross anatomy of the plant body is indicated in the

ftgveda which clearly distinguishes wood (daru) from the softer part of a 
tree. Majumdar (G. P.) (1) observes that the ancient Hindus differentiated 
the stem broadly into two parts— the outer called the tvac, valkala (skin) and 
the inner the sdra, that is the wood or essence enclosing the pith (majjd) 
and lasting till the end. The Taittirlya Samhitd separates the outer part 
into two layers, the outer valka and the inner valkala. The Brhadaranya- 
kopani^ad, while comparing a human being with a tree, provides some 
information about the internal structure of the latter as follows: 

‘A man is indeed like a mighty tree; his hairs are his leaves and 
his skin is its outer bark. The blood flows from the skin (of man), 
so does the sap from the skin (of the tree). Thus blood flows from a 
wounded man in the same manner as sap from a tree that is struck. 
His flesh (corresponds to what is) within the inner bark, his nerves 
are as tough as the inner fibres (of the tree). His bones lie behind his 
flesh as the wood lies behind the soft tissue (Mara). The marrow 
(of the human bone) resembles the pith (of the tree).*'^ 

It is clearly noticed that a plant is divided internally into an epidermis 
(tvac), a bast or softer tissue (Mara), fibrous tissue (kindta) within the 
bast, the inner wood (daru) and the pith (majjd) embedded in the wood. 

From the use of such words as sakrt (animal refuse) and karha (dried 
cow-dung) in the Rgveda some scholars have inferred the knowledge of 
manuring, but such an interpretation does not readily follow from the 
context. The Rgvedic expression, d nimrucah Mrdeka apdbharatkim . . . , 
means ‘one carries off the refuse at the sunset’. In the Taittirlya Samhitd, 
the cow-dung is hailed at one place, e.g. yacchakrt karoti tasmai svdhd, but 
it does not imply knowledge of manuring. Somewhat indicative, however, 
is the following statement in the Atharvaveda:^ 

karisinim phalavatltp svadhdmirdm ca no grhe | 
audumbarasya tejasd dhdtd pusfim dadhatu me || 

which has been translated by Whitney as follows: 

‘Rich in manure, rich in fruit, svadhd and cheer in our house- 
prosperity let dhdtar assign to me through the keenness of the (amulet 
of) udumbara* 

The Taittirlya Samhitd clearly mentions the ripening of corn twice in 
the year, dvih samvatsarasya sasyam pacyate,^ but whether it also indicates

rotation of crops, as stated by Majumdar,® is difficult to follow. Some 
idea as to the manufacture and storage of food may be obtained from stray 
references in the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad, and the Maitrdyani and the 
Kdthaka Samhitas, where waters are regarded as the essence of the earth 
{prthivydh dpah\ herbs as the essence of water (apdmosadhydh), flowers as 
the essence of herbs {o^adhlndm puspani) and fruits as the essence of flowers 
{puspdndm phaldni).^ 

From the time of the Rgveda, some conscious effort at classification is 
reflected in the naming of plants based on their morphological characteristics. 
Plants are in the first place broadly divided into three groups, e.g. trees 
(vrksa), herbs (osadhi) and creepers (virudh). Plants are also classified as 
flowering (puspavatl) and non-flowering, fruit-bearing (phalavatl) and 
fruitless.*^ All types of grass are described as trna. The Atharvaveda, as 
we have already noticed, subdivides the herbs into several types according 
to their morphological or other special properties, e.g. prastrnatJ (spreading), 
stamhinl (bushy), eko~hngd (with single calyx), pratanvati (extending), 
anmmati (rich in shoots), kdndini (jointed), vi^dkhd (having extending 
branches), jivald (lively), naghdrisd (harmless) and madhumatl (richly sweet). 
Another interesting feature noticed in the Vdjasaneyl Samhitd, Tattirlya 
Brdhmana and the Atharvaveda is the description of an entire locality by 
the type of plants growing in that area, e.g. nadvala (a place abounding in 
reeds), ^ipdJya (a region" where the plant sipala grows). 

POST-VEDIC CLASSICAL PERIOD 
Plant Science in Medical Works 

For tracing the development of plant science in this period, we have 
again to depend largely on varied types of Sanskrit literature. In the first 
place, we have the medical treatises of Caraka, Su^ruta, Vagbhata and 
their various recensions and commentaries, which carried on and further 
developed the Vedic emphasis on herbals for the treatment and cure of 
diseases and in the process recorded further progress made in the plant 
science in general. Caraka unhesitatingly observes that a pharmacologist 
is one who knows the uses and actions of herbs though he may not know 
their forms (morphology), but an expert physician is one who knows the 
herbs botanically, pharmacologically and in every other respect.** Accord- 
ing to the Dhanvantari Nighanfu, ‘the physician does well to rmsier bhe^aja- 
vidya by acquainting himself with the various names of plants in Sanskrit 
and Prakrt, consulting all classes of men, by personal observations, by a

careful handling, as well as by a careful consideration of its specific charac- 
ters and sexuality’.® The use of the term bhe^ajavidya is significant 
inasmuch as it implies the existence of a separate science devoted to the 
study of plants and plant-life with special reference to their medicinal 
properties. 

Plant Science in the Purdnas, Arthasdstra and Brhatsamhitd 

The Agnipurdna, the Arthasdstra and the Brhatsatnhitd have each a 
section or sections devoted to plant science {vrksdyurveda) in general. 
These sections deal with collection and selection of seeds, germination, 
grafting, cutting, sowing, planting and nursing, soil selection, manuring, 
meteorological conditions favourable for plant growth, location of plants 
for improving the aesthetic and hygienic surroundings of the homestead, etc. 
All these sections, in which the agricultural bias is predominant, give one 
the impression that a separate vrksdyurveda had been in existence con- 
currently with works on agriculture. Kautilya, in his chapter on the 
duties of the Superintendent of Agriculture, used the term krsitantra-gulma- 
vrksdyurveda and possibly indicated two departments of knowledge, one the 
krsitantra dealing with agriculture and the other guJmavrksdyurveda 
dealing with plant science. The existence of plant science as a separate 
branch of knowledge is also corroborated by Vatsyayana’s Kdmasutra in 
which vrksdyurveda is mentioned as one of the 64 arts recognized in ancient 
India. The existence of the Krsi Pardsara, a well-known treatise on agri- 
culture, has long since been known. The discovery of a manuscript of the 
vrksdyurveda, also attributed to Para§ara, which we shall discuss in some 
detail further on, has now left no doubt as to the development of plant science 
as a separate branch of knowledge by its own right, possibly during the 
post-Vedic period, but before the beginning of the Christian era. 

Philosophical and Miscellaneous Texts 

The Nydya-Vaise^ika texts and their commentaries, Amara’s lexico- 
graphy and the epics, the Rdmdyana and the Mahdbhdrata, occasionally 
provide botanical information of value. 

Pardsara's Vrksdyurveda 

In contrast to the type of literature mentioned above which is concerned 
with medicine, polity, epic poetry or matters of general interest and which 
deals with, or refers to, certain aspects of botany only incidentally, Para- 
^ara’s Vrksdyurveda is a full-fledged treatise on plant science. A copy of 
the manuscript of this much referred to botanical work was discovered by 
the late Vaidya^astrl Jogendranath Vi§agratna of Navadwip, whose son 
N. N. Sircar published an account of it, with extensive quotations, in the 
Journal of the Asiatic Society in 1950. The work possibly dates from 


Mfyumdar (G. P.) (1), pp. 8-9.

A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


the first century B.c. or the first century a.d. Written in the sutra style, 
the work is divided into six parts, e.g. vijotpattikdn^, \anaspatikdn4a, 
vdnaspatyakdnda, virudhavallJkdn^a, gulma-k^upakdnda and cikitsitakdn^a. 
The last part dealing with the treatment of plant diseases is missing from 
the extant manuscript. The first part, the vijotpattikdnda, is further sub- 
divided into eight chapters, e.g. vljotpattisutrlyddhydya (an outline of plant 
morphology), bhumivargadhydya (nature and properties of soil), vana- 
vargddhydya (description and distribution of forests), vrksdngasutrlyddhydya 
(more detailed treatment of the morphology of plant members), pu^pdnga- 
sutr'iyddhydya (flower, its parts, functions and classification), phaldnga- 
sutrlyddhydya (definition, function and classification of fruits), astdnga- 
sutrlyddhydya (discussion of eight plant limbs — root, stem, bark, heart- 
wood, sap, excretions, oleaginous products and spines and prickles) and 
dviganlyddhydya (seeds and embryonic plants). 

Sircar states that Vrksdyurveda evidently formed the basis of botanical 
teaching preparatory to pharmaceutical studies in ancient India, an arrange- 
ment comparable to modern practice. It also appears that Parasara’s 
method of botanical nomenclature based on three types of synonyms, e.g. 
those of botanical significance (paricayajndpikd samjm), those with thera- 
peutic index {gmaprakd^ikd samjm) and those associated with names of 
habitats or special events, was largely followed by Caraka, Susruta and 
other authors of medical treatises in preparing chapters on ayurvedic 
pharmacopoeias. Accordingly, a further importance attaches to this work 
inasmuch as it can help in the identification of plants mentioned in ancient 
medical treatises. 


BOTANICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE PERIOD 

We shall now attempt to summarize the botanical knowledge as devel- 
oped in this period and preserved in the various texts mentioned above, 
including Para^ara’s special monograph on plant science. As before, it 
will be profitable to assess the materials under the conventional subject 
divisions such as seed and germination, morphology, physiology, ecology, 
taxonomy, and so on. 

Seed and Germination 

The technical term used for the seed is vija. The seed is enclosed in 
a vessel called vljako^a. The kernel or endosperm is called sasya and the 
cotyledon vijapatra. ParS^ara uses the term vijamdtrkd to denote cotyledon 
and recognizes monocotyledonous (ekamdtfkavija) and dicotyledonous 
(dvimdtrkavija) seeds. By this term is also meant the endosperm {vtja- 
mdtrkd tu vijasasyamX enclosing the adivijapatra which may mean either 
the plumule or the cotyledon itself, which appears as the first leaf after 
germination. The cotyledon stores food material for the nourishment of 
the embryo. 



BOTANY 


381 


Germination is expressed by the term ankurodbheda, which means 
sprouting of the seed to life; ankura means the seedling. Conditions for 
successful germination are given as air, water and the season guaranteeing 
the proper warmth. According to Su^ruta, proper season, good soil, 
requisite supply of water and good seeds all taken together help in the 
germination of seed.® Guijaratna in his commentary on the ^addarsana- 
samuccaya states that the seeds of va(a (Ficus indica), pippala (Ficus 
religiosa), nimba (Melia azadirachta) and others germinate during the rainy 
season under the influence of dew and air.*' 

Para^ara gives a more graphic description of the process of germination. 
During the sprouting up of the seedling (praroha), its body receives nourish- 
ment from the cotyledons. This nourishment enables the seedling to grow 
until its root develops and comes of its own. The cotyledons dry up as 
soon as the seedling is able independently to receive nourishment directly 
from the soil of the earth.^ 


MORPHOLOGY 

Root 

Plants are divided broadly into two parts, the subterranean part called 
mula (root) and the aerial part called vistara or tula (shoot). The mula 
means an organ by which the plant is fixed to the soil. The use of the 
word padapa to mean a plant is significant as it implies the ability of the 
plant to absorb water from the soil with the help of its root, the pada. 
Various types of adventitious root — fibrous roots originating in the branches 
(sakha siphd), prop roots (aharoha)—2iTQ recognized. The Arthasdstra 
indicates knowledge of edible bulbous roots. 

Shoot and Stem 

The shoot comprises the stem and leaves. The stem is called kdnda 
and the main stem, that is the portion between the root and the place of 
origin of the branches, prakanda. The Vedic term skandha is also retained. 
In the case of vanaspati and vanaspatya^ stems are strong and erect, whereas 
in the case of valli, vratati or lata, these are weak, necessitating some kind 
of support such as trees which these may embrace or entwine (valll vesfayate 
vrksam). Plants may be with or without stems. Nodes (parva or granthi) 
and intemodes, caudex (sthdnu) and branches in the descending order — 
sdkhd, pratiidkhd and anusdkhd — ^are described. Underground stems which

act like roots but are not true roots are recognized and termed kanda (yan- 
mulameva vJjam sa kandah). 

Differentiation of plants into trees, shrubs and herbs on the basis of 
their stems being long or short, hard or less strong, or succulent is notice- 
able. The term vrksadani meaning a guest plant sucking food from the 
host plant clearly points to a parasite, and the term vrksdruha (living on 
another tree) is nothing but the description of epiphytes. Mosses {hivdla), 
green algae (jalamli) and mushroom (chatrd) are recognized as lower plants. 

Leaf 

Patra and parna used to denote leaf are derived from its falling nature 
and its green colour. A leaf may be petiolate {savrnta, patravrnta) or 
sessile {vrntahina). The leaf blade or lamina is called paksa and may be, 
according to Para^ara, of four kinds, e.g. samapaksa (two wings sym- 
metrical), mamapaksa (two wings asymmetrical), samakarna (symmetrically 
incised) and visamakarna (asymmetrically incised). In the petiolate leaf, 
the petiole may be attached to the base of the lamina {prdntagranthika) or 
to the axis (stem) {vrntahandhana). The Vrksdyurveda reveals knowledge 
of the phyllotaxis called patrabandhana, of which various types are dealt 
with. Compound leaves are differentiated from the simple and named 
after the number of leaflets, e.g. dvipatra, tripatra, saptapatra, and so on. 
The leaves have also been described and named after their shapes, e.g. 
ahaparnaka (Shorea robusta)^ resembling the ear of a horse, musikaparm 
{Salvinia), resembling the ear of a mouse, kUaparm {Achyranthes aspera\ 
resembling the ear of a monkey.® 

We now know that there are two principal types of venation, e.g. 
parallel in which the veins run more or less parallel to one another, and 
reticulate when the veinlels are irregularly arranged. Para^ara observes 
that veins carry nutrients to the leaves and are visible like so many lines. 
The venation is of two types, namely pragma and vellita; in the former the 
veins are arranged in parallel and in the latter obliquely in the form of a 
network. Leaves characterized by pragma venation are called maunjapatra 
and those by the vellita are termed jdUkapatraf 

Flower 

Parts of a typical flower are named as prasavabandhanOy puspavrnta 
(pedicel), sihdlaka (thalamus), jdlaka (sepals), dala^ puspadala (petals). No 
suitable name for androecium is available, but its component parts, e.g. 
stamens {keiara)^ anther {kWjalka) and pollen grains (pardga, kehrarenu), 
are recognized. Likewise, the parts of a gynoecium are named as vfjddhdra 
(ovary), vardfaka (style) and vardtakaiirsa (stigma).

In the chapter entitled puspangasuirfyddhySya of the Vrk?dyurveda, the 
peculiarities in the arrangement of floral leaves, particularly the gynoecium 
in the thalamus, have been used as criteria for classifying flowers into four 
types, e.g. tundapuspamandala, kumbhapuspamandala, tufigapuspamandala 
and vafyapu^pamandala. The first is a typical flower and is hypogynous 
(puspakrdnta-vijddhdra); that is stamens, petals and sepals are inserted 
below the gynoecium. In the second type, sepals, petals and stamens are 
inserted above the gynoecium, that is flowers belonging to this type are 
epigynous {puspa^irsa-vljddhdra). In the tufigapuspamandala, the thalamus 
assumes the form of a cup and supports the gynoecium in the middle and 
the stamens, petals and sepals along the rim, giving rise to perigynous 
(sthalakotsanga) flowers. In the fourth type, the stamens are fused to form 
a tube or an elongated mortar (ulukhala) covering up the ovary. Flowers 
of this class described by Para^ara as vdtyamandalagam are typical of the 
Malvaceae family. 

Fruit 

Different kinds of fruits such as green (saldtu), fleshy (ksJraka), dry 
{vana) and legume (hmi, simba) are recognized. Para^ara has a special 
chapter on fruits (phaldngasutrJyddhydya), in which functions and classi- 
fication of fruits are discussed. 


HISTOLOGY 

Development of preliminary ideas as to the internal structure of plants 
has been noticed in the Vedic literature, particularly in the Upanisads. 
The Vrksdyurveda records considerable advancement in this field by present- 
ing a detailed internal structure of the leaf. This was thought necessary to 
explain the function of the leaf about which Para^ara had a few interesting 
observations to make. A leaf contains a large number of invisible (ona- 
vaha) cells {rasakosa), each covered by a cell-wall (kaldvesiitena) of fine 
membrane (suk^mapatrakd). These cells store the sap containing the 
five elemental properties (pdncabhautikaguna samanvitasya rasasydsayah) as 
also a colorific principle {ranjakayukta). The plant body possesses several 
transporting systems {sarvasrotdrpsi). This system in the stem, which 
distributes rasa from the earth to the various plant organs, is called syandanJ, 
and the one working in the leaves is called sirdjdldni. The transporting 
system has both upward and downward channels {sirdbhikopasarpayanti 
apasarpayanti ca bhdvdbhdvau). 


PHYSIOLOGY 

That plants possess several characteristics of life such as growth, move- 
ment, sleep, waking, disease, transmission of characters, etc., was noticed 
by the various philosophical schools in India. Udayana of the Vaik^ika 



384 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


school observes, in his Kiranavally that plants constantly manifest the 
phenomena of living, death, dream, waking, susceptibility to diseases, 
drugging, movement towards what is favourable and repulsion from what 
is unfavourable as if these are living bodies.® The Buddhist logician 
Dharmottara records, in his Nyayavindufika, the phenomenon of sleep in 
certain plants, in the form of contraction of their leaves during night. 
Gunaratna, in his $a4darsana-samuccaya, enumerates dilferent character- 
istics of life. The plants pass through three stages of infancy, youth and 
age; they have growth; their various kinds of movement are conditioned by 
sleep, waking, response to touch or need for support. Plants are able to 
deal with wounds and laceration sustained by their organs and make use 
of drugs to overcome wounds as well as diseases. Assimilation of the 
food from the soil is determined by requirements of plants for growth, 
decay, fighting for diseases, and so on.^ A list of plants showing the 
phenomena of sleep and waking is mentioned, and lajjavatl lata {Mimosa 
pudica) is specifically cited as an instance of a plant sensitive to touch. 
The different philosophical schools in India had thus unanimously recognized 
plants as living organisms. That such a view must have crystallized during 
the period of the Samhitds and Upanisads is borne out by frequent com- 
parison of plants with animals as, for example, the likening of the plant to 
the human body to which we have already referred. 

Nourishment 

As to the physiology of nourishment, scattered references amply indi- 
cate the knowledge that plants receive their food materials from the soil 
in the form of solution through the agency of the root. The use of the 
term padapa for the root, as already pointed out, is significant. In the 
Mahabharata, plants are stated to drink water with the help of air just as 
water is sucked to the mouth through the lotus petiole.^ Majumdar has 
argued that the analogy, though imperfect, indicates that ‘the knowledge 
of the existence of the sucking force in the leaves of trees corresponding to 
the existence of a sucking force in the mouth of man— a knowledge which 
is only a very recent discovery— was an accomplished possession with the 
ancients’. Para^ara’s transporting systems, e.g. syandani in the stem and 
sirdjdldni in the leaves, are clearly stated to be engaged in the important 
work of transporting and circulating sap. The phenomenon of the cir- 
culation of sap also appears in Kanada’s Vaisesika Sutra: utsrotasastamah

praya antaspadd viksinaht.^ Moreover, Parai^ara’s elaborate histology of 
the leaf and recognition of the presence in it of colouring matters {ranjaka) 
are not without significance, as these together with the use of such ex- 
pression as raHjakena pacyamdndt (digested with the help of colouring 
matters), accor^ng to Sircar, point to the knowledge of food manufacture 
in the leaves. 

Plant Pathology 

Plant diseases and their treatment received careful attention. Accord- 
ing to Varahamihira, plant diseases are caused by cold climate (low tem- 
perature), wind (dryness) and sun (heat) and indicated by the yellowness 
of the leaves, non- or under-development of buds, dryness of the branches 
and the exudation of the sap. The same view is held by Ka^yapa. Guna- 
ratna observes that plants are afflicted by diseases, displacement or dis- 
location of flower, fruit, leaves and bark in the same way as the human 
body sulTers from jaundice, dropsy, emaciation, stunted growth of finger, 
nose, etc., and respond to treatment like human bodies. Varahamihira’s 
prophylactic treatment includes the application to the root of mud kneaded 
with ghee and viclahga and thereafter of milk diluted with water. The 
Aguipurdna prescribes a mixture of vidahga with rice, fish and flesh. For 
the cure of barrenness, the Brhatsamhitd and the Agnipurdna prescribe a 
hot decoction prepared of kulattha {Dolichos biflorus), mdsa (Phaseolus 
mungo), mudga {Ph. radiatus), tila {Sesamum indicum) and yava (barley), 
which is to be applied to the root. 

Reproduction, Sex and Heredity 

Reproduction of plants by fruits and seeds, roots, cuttings, graftings, 
plant apices and leaves was well known. ^ Buddha Ghosa, in his Sumahgala- 
yildsinl, a commentary on the DJgha Nikdya, describes some of these 
methods under such terms as mula-vija (root-seed), khandabija (cutting), 
phaluvija (joints), agravija (budding) and bija-blja (seed). Propagation by 
seeds (blja-bJja or vJjaruha) is referred to in the Atharvaveda and by Manu. 
The Arthakstra mentions cases of plant propagation by bulbous roots 
(kdndavlja). The method of cuttings (also called skandhavija) is described 
in the ArthaMstra, Brhatsamhitd and Sumahgala-vildsinl in the case of 
sugar-cane, jack-fruit, blackberry, pomegranate, vine, lemon tree, ahattha 
(Ficus religiosa), nyagrodha (Ficus bengalensis), udumbara (F. glomerata) 
and several others. The method of grafting which consists in inserting the 
cutting of one tree into the stem of another is considered by Varahamihira 
as superior to cutting. Plants like betel, samirana, ajjuka (Ocimum basili- 
cum) and hiriverum (Andropogon cynanthus) are propagated by the agravija 
method.

A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


Some vague ideas regarding sexuality in plants are noticeable in the 
Hdrita- and Caraka-samhitds. Questions are raised as to why there are 
no flowers and fruits produced except sexually or why the same kind of 
fruition is not perceived in women as in plants. One answer, put in the 
mouth of Atreya, is that the seed is the result of co-operation of different 
sexes among the creeping and the fixed plants, and its quality varies accord- 
ing to the sperm.® The fixed plants are endowed with the male (siva) 
and the female {§akti) principles. Caraka recognizes male categories of 
plants bearing white flowers, large fruits and tender leaves and the female 
categories characterized by yellow flowers, small fruits, short stalk, etc. 
Of special importance is the case of ketakl {Pandanus odoratissimus) men- 
tioned in the Rdjanighantu and the Dhanvantari Nighantu. Always referred 
to as a couple (ketakidvaya), the male plant is called the sltaketaki and the 
female one the svarnaketakl The former is sometimes called simply 
ketaka in the male gender or biphald, that is unproductive of fruits, and the 
latter kanakaprasavd, that is the plant which produces a golden harvest. 

From the time of the Brdhmams, the question of transmission of 
characters has been posed. Caraka and Su^ruta go as far as to state that 
the fertilized ovum contains in miniature all the organs of the plant, 
e.g. the bamboo seed containing in miniature the entire structure of the 
bamboo tree, and further that the male sperm cells have minute elements 
derived from each of its organs and tissues. Such ideas closely resemble 
Darwin’s ‘gemmules’ and Spencer’s ‘ids’. 


TAXONOMY 

Systematization of any branch of knowledge through proper nomen- 
clature and classification appears to be a speciality of the ancient Indians. 
This is clearly noticeable in botany which provides a natural scope to the 
systematizer. 

Nomenclature 

Plants have been named in consideration of (1) special association, 
(2) special property such as medicinal, domestically useful, etc., (3) morpho- 
logical characteristics, e.g. shape of leaf, number of leaflets in a compound 
leaf, shape and colour of flowers, etc., (4) local association, (5) environ- 
mental association and (6) other peculiarities. An attempt to express either 
the salient external features or some prominent qualities, medicinal or other- 
wise, is clearly reflected in the system. Thus bodhidruma (Ficus religiosa\ 
aioka (Saraca indica) and iivakkhara (Datura) are examples of special 
association; dadrughna (Cassia fistula), arioghna (Amorphophallus cam- 
panulatus), ku^fhand^ini (somaraji), dantadhdvana (Acacia catechu), kdrpdsa

etc. ; saubira {Zizyphus jujuba), magadhl (jasmine), vaidehi (pepper), jalajOy 
pankeruha (lotus) and maruvaka {Ocimum sp.) are examples of naming on the 
basis of local or environmental associations. Consideration of so many 
factors has often led to the coining of multiple names for the same plant, e.g. 
vakrapuspa (plant having curved flowers) and vrandrJ (enemy of boils) for 
the plant Sesbania grandiflora; kantaphala (having spiny fruits), ghantd- 
puspa (possessing bell-shaped flowers) and mahamohl (great intoxicator) 
for the plant Datura alba.^ The system impressed William Jones so much 
that he remarked that Linnaeus would have probably adopted the Hindu 
method had he known the Sanskrit language. 

Classification 

Plants were classified in accordance with three distinct principles, e.g. 
botanical (udbhida), medicinal (virecanM) and dietetic (annapdnddi). 
Compared to the broad Vedic classification of plants into v^ksa, osadhi and 
vJrudhy attempts of this period are much more elaborate and scientific. 

Manu divided plants under eight classes as follows:*^ 

(1) Osadhi—hQSinng abundant flowers and fruits, but withering 

away after fructification, e.g, rice, wheat. 

(2) Vanaspati-—bca,nng fruits without evident flowers. 

(3) Ff/ri’a— bearing both flowers and fruits. 

(4) Guccha — bushy herbs, e.g. Jasminum {mallikd). 

(5) Gulma — succulent shrubs. 

(6) Trna — grasses, 

(7) Pratana—cxQQpm which spread their stems on the ground. 

(8) Fa/Zf—climbers and entwiners. 

SuSruta and Caraka more or less adhered to the broad-based classi- 
fication of the Vedic period and recognized some of the classes given by 
Manu as forming subclasses. According to them, plants are of four classes : ^ 

(1) Vanaspati—'^Ydc]). bears fruits but not flowers. 

(2) Vi^ksa or vdnaspatya — ^which bears both fruits and flowers. 

(3) VIrudh — which creeps on the ground or entwines. 

(4) annual herbs which wither away after fructification. 

Susruta’s commentator Palhana gives plak^a {Ficus infectoria) and 
udambara {Ficus glomerata) as examples of vanaspati and the mango and

the jamdu {Eugenia jambolana) as examples of fruit- and flower-bearing 
subdivides vJrudhs into two groups, pratdnavatya (creepers with 
spreading stems on the ground) and gulminya (succulent herbs); and cites 
wheat and barley as examples of osadhi which wither away after fructi- 
fication. Caraka’s commentator Cakrapani subdivides virudhs into lata 
(creeper), gulma and o^adhis into annuals or perennials bearing fruits and 
grasses which go without fruits. 

The Vaisesikas classify plants under seven heads, e.g. vfki^a, tfna, 
osadhi, gulma, lata, avatdna and vanaspati.^ Defining the characteristics of 
the various groups, Udayana, in his Kirandvali, remarks that vrksas are 
plants endowed with trunks and branches bearing flowers and fruits {vfk^dh 
puspaphalavantah skandha^akhinah)', tfnas are exemplified by ulapa and like 
plants {trndnyulapadini); osadhis are plants like kalama, which perish after 
their fruits ripen {osadhyah phalapdkdntdh kalamddayah); gulmas are plants 
like bhdtd {gulmd bhafah); latds are represented by kusmdnda, a species of 
Cucurbit a (latdh kusmandiprabhriayah); avatdnas are plants like ketaki 
(avatdndh ketakyddayah); and vanaspatis are trees that produce fruits with- 
out flowers {vanaspatayo vind puspam phalinah). 

Parasara, in his Vrksdyuryeda, has developed a more elaborate classi- 
fication based largely on morphological consideration such as floral charac- 
ters, their resemblances and differences. In his system, plants are classified 
into families {gana vibhdga), of which some examples are given below: 

SamJgamya (Legummosea)~-Th\s family is represented by samJ- 
vrk?a, a plant bearing simhiphala, i.e. a legume or pod, and leaves held 
on a common stalk, which are compound in nature, with leaflets arranged 
like a feather. Flowers of plants of this family are hypogynous {puspa- 
krantabijadhdra) and five-petalled, with gamosepalous calyx and an 
androecium of 10 stamens. Three subtypes are: vakra-puspa, vikarnika- 
puspa and suka-puspa. 

Puplikaganiya (Rutaceae) — ^The plants bear spines, odoriferous 
leaves and winged petioles and hypogynous flowers {tundaman^ala) 
with free petals and stamens. Fruits formed of superior ovary {puspa- 
krdntaphala) contain hairy succulent flesh and multiple seeds. Ke^a- 
raka and mdluraphala are its two subtypes. 

Svastikdganiya {Cruciferae)—lhQ name is derived from the shape 
of the calyx which looks like a svastikd. The flower has four sepals, 
four petals and six stamens, all free, and a superior ovary {tunda- 
mantjkila). In the inflorescence flowers are arranged in rows. The 
two carpels are fused to form a bi-locular fruit (dvipufa) of which the 
wall is sutured to give it the appearance of a leguminous fruit. 

Tripu^pagamya (CMcurhiVaccue)— Plants of this class bear epigynous 
{kumbhamandala) flowers which are sometimes unisexual. The flower 
has five sepals, five petals which are united, three stamens and a style

with three-pointed stigma (iriitr^avardfa). The ovary is tri-locular 
(trivartaka) and produces several seeds. 

Mallikaganiya (Apocynaceae) — Plants of this class give an in- 
florescence of a mixed type and bear hermaphrodite {samdfiga) flowers 
having united calyx and corolla, each five-membered, and five stamens, 
epipetalous (avyaktakehra). The fruit is a follicle of two chambers 
and seeds are endowed with tufts of long fine hairs (tulapuccha- 
samanvitd). 

Kurcapu^pagamya (Compositeae)— In this case, the flowers are 
sessile and borne on a common axis surrounded by a common calyx 
so as to make the assemblage look like bristles on a brush head {kured- 
kdra), whence the name. The ovary is inferior (puspasirsakabJjddhara). 


ECOLOGY 

The period under review shows some awareness of the dependence of 
structural and functional peculiarities of plants upon environmental condi- 
tions, Caraka and Susruta divide land into different regions according 
to the nature of soil, climate and vegetation. There are several references 
to plants typical of these regions, which clearly indicate their interest in 
plant ecology. The regions and their characteristic vegetation may be 
summarized as follows: 

Jdngala region is characterized by open spaces, dry wilderness or 
deserts, and scarcity of rivers and rivulets, in fact, of water resources 
in general. Some of the typical plants of this region, as mentioned by 
Caraka, include khadira {Acacia catechu), Mlakt {BosweUia serrata), 
sdla {Shorea robusta), asvattha {Ficus religiosa), vata {F. bengalensis), 
dmalaki {Phyllanthus emhlicd) and simhpd {Dalbergia sissoo).^ 

Anupa region means a marshy or swampy tract, abounding in a 
large number of pools, traversed by a net of rivers and overgrown with 
forests. The vegetation of anupa region, according to Varahamihira, 
includes jambu {Eugenia jambolana), vetasa {Calamus rotung), kadamba 
{Anthocephalus cadamba), draksd (vines), arjuna {Terminalia arjuna) 
and several others. According to Caraka, dense forests of hintdla 
{Phoenix paludosa), tala {Borassus flabellifer), tamdla {Cinnamomum 
tamala) and ndrikela {Cocos nucifera) typify such swampy regions. 

Sadhdrana, meaning ordinary, is an intermediate region which 
has some features common to both the jdngala and the anupa. Such 
regions are good for the growth of both vanaspatis and vdnaspatyas. 

Kautilya differentiated between the jdngala and the anupa regions by 
the amount of rainfall. For the jdngala, this amount is 16 dronas, whereas 
for the anUpa it is half as much more.^

ARBORI-HORTICULTURE 

The science of arbori-horticulture developed during this period as a 
distinct discipline. Much of the Vrk^ayurveda deal with the construction 
and maintenance of gardens and parks for health, recreation and enjoyment 
of the public. The existence of the science in a rudimentary form can be 
traced to the Rgvedic times. All decent houses and places of noblemen 
and kings had pleasure and kitchen gardens attached to them. 

Public gardens and parks were placed under the charge of superinten- 
dents who were required to know the causes of growth and development of 
flowers and fruits, the methods of planting and curing trees by the adminis- 
tration of proper soil and water at the suitable time and the various uses 
of plants as medicinal drugs. The knowledge of grafting was one of the 
qualifications of the gardener, and it came to be regarded as one of the 
64 kalds or arts. According to Vatsyayana, all big houses and palaces of 
kings had a pleasure garden, v^ksavafikd or pu^pavafikd,^ Methods of 
plant propagation by seed, cutting, layering, grafting and budding were 
prevalent and one finds mention of them in the Vedas ^ Arthasdstra and 
Brhatsarphitd. Jacolliot remarked, ‘We should not forget that India, 
that immense and luminous centre in olden times, was in constant com- 
munication with all the people of Asia and that all the philosophers and 
sages of antiquity went there to study the science of life.’^ 

In the Buddhist literature we find description of pleasure gardens of 
king Bimbisara and A§oka as places of diversion. The tree at Buddha 
Gaya under which Gautama attained enlightenment was a pipul {Ficus 
religiosa) and its branches were taken far and wide and planted. 

We have a chapter entitled the Upavanavinoda as a branch of Vrksdyur- 
veda in Sarngdhara’s encyclopedic work, the Sdrngdhara PaddhatU 
composed during the thirteenth century a.d. The text has been edited and 
translated by Majumdar (G. P.) (3). The treatise was compiled at the 
conunand of his king for the benefit of his subjects. The following topics 
are discussed: glory of trees; good and evil omens relating to residence 
near the trees; selection of soil; classification of plants; sowing of seeds; 
watering of plant; the rule for the protection of plants; construction of 
garden houses; examination of soil where wells are to be dug; rules for 
nourishment of plants; kunapa water (recipe for natural solution); treatment 
of plants in diseases and health; and botanical marvels (experimental 
results).® The Arthasdstra, the Kdmasutra, the Sukraniti and literature of 
this class indicate that there were forest departments which were placed 
under expert forest officers whose duty it was to develop new plantations, 
administer forest laws and accomplish in every possible way the economic 
development of the forest resources of the State.

In ValmJki’s Ramayana, the poet lists several plants of the Chitrakuta 
Hills while describing the journey of Rama, Lak§mapa and SitS. Mention 
is made in the Ramayaria that Sita was confined by Ravana in a grove of 
A5oka trees (Saraca indica). Kadamba {Anthocephalus cadamba) was closely 
connected with the life of Srikrsna, and its abundance in the past near 
Mathura and Brindaban is perhaps an evidence of more humid climate 
prevailing in this area in those days. 

Tulasi (Ocimum sanctum) had the pride of place and is still grown in 
many Hindu houses. 

Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) is referred to in the Purdnas, Brahma 
emerged from the lotus which grew out of the navel of Vi§nu. In the days 
of Mohenjo-daro, lotus blossoms were wreathed over the head of the Sun- 
god. Sidhu was prepared from the flowers of mahud {Madhuca indica) 
tree, kharjura from juice of date-palm {Phoenix sylvestris) and surd from 
cereals. Cannabis fibre {Cannabis sativa) was known and bhdhg prepared 
from its leaves was often used as an intoxicant. Among the beverages, 
fermented drinks were known, as there was somarasa, the drink of the gods. 
In spite of its special virtue of giving immortality, the origin of somarasa 
remains unsolved. Rauwolfia serpentina, which has now earned world- 
wide popularity, finds mention in ancient Hindu manuscripts as well as 
in Caraka. The plant is described, under its Sanskrit name sarpagandha, 
as a useful remedy for snake-bite and insect-stings. Because of its curative 
effect in cases of insanity it has long been known in Hindi as PagaUki- 
Dawa. 

Kalidasa refers to plants featured in personal adornment and beauti- 
fication at the home, e.g. tdmbula or pan {Piper betle), supdri {Areca 
catechu), cardamom {Elettaria cardamomum), campaka {Michelia champaca), 
sandal paste {Santalum album), etc. The Brhatsamhitd contains references 
to various types of toothpicks, hair-oils, perfumes and recipes for dyeing 
the hair. 

Bengal had direct maritime intercourse with the Far Eastern countries. 
China and the Far East used to import at least a part of the sandalwood 
{Santalum album) from India even up to about the eighth or ninth century 
A.D. Sandalwood was a ‘royal tree’ and people had no right to its culti- 
vation. It was a naturally growing plant in India. The appearance of 
sandal trees along with mango {Mangifera indica) trees in the sculptured 
railings of Bharhut is a proof of their growing in India at least from the 
second century b.c. 

Of the greatest importance as an article of export, was black pepper 
{Piper nigrum), a native of the western coast of India. It was well known 
to the Greeks and later taken to Europe by Arab traders either through 
the Persian Gulf, Mesopotamia, Syria or through the Red Sea and the 
Gulf of Suez. At one time pepper was weighed against silver and gold 
and it was the high price of pepper which acted as the chief incentive for 
Europeans to find a sea route to India.

BOTANY IN THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD FROM ARABIC 
AND PERSIAN SOURCES 

K. A. Chowdhury 

To start with, written information for this period on botany, as a biolo- 
gical science, is almost nil. Nobody seems to have taken enough interest to 
collect basic knowledge in various disciplines of botany, such as classifica- 
tion, morphology, physiology and ecology, etc. The main emphasis has 
been on the utilization of plant products for food, shelter and clothes. 
Almost all the reports are confined to agriculture, horticulture and 
forest produce. From this scanty information it is not possible to trace 
chronologically the advancement of knowledge in any of these products. 
Some broad-based general conclusion is, however, possible and that is 
what has been done here. 

Speaking generally, the agricultural produce of the country as a whole 
could not have been very much different from what it is today. A few 
plants introduced in the country during this period will be dealt with 
elsewhere. 

Wheat 

During the reign of Delhi Sultanate, according to Amir Khusrau,® 
the chief crops were pulses, wheat, barley, millet, peas, rice, sesame oil- 
seeds, sugar-cane and cotton. Canal irrigation introduced by FIruz Shah 
Tughluq near Hissar and FIruzabad greatly improved the production of 
wheat, sugar-cane, sesame and pulses in these areas. The city of Delhi used 
to get wheat, rice and sugar-cane from Manikpur (near Allahabad) because 
of the high quality of crops produced there. During Akbar’s time wheat 
{Triticum sp.) was grown throughout north India, and in the states of central, 
western and eastern parts. In Bengal wheat was grown in sufficient quantity 
although it was recognized that the quality was not so good.^ During this 
period of 600 years, no mention has been made of varieties of wheat in 
any record. This is rather surprising because with different climate-soils, 
complex in the country with almost no irrigation, one could expect varieties 
of wheat which would grow well in different localities. 

Rice 


Cultivation of rice {Oryza sativa L.) during Akbar’s time shows that 
more than one variety was in existence. According to yim,® three varieties 
were cultivated in the subahs of Agra, Allahabad and Oudh. These were 
dark-coloured rice (Persian: shall mushkin), mmj rice (believed to be 
related to the present bdsmati variety grown in Dehra Dun and adjoining

districts) and the common rice. Another variety that used to be grown in 
Bengal is mentioned also in the Ain as given below;® 

‘If single grains of each kind were collected, they would fill a 
large vase. It is sown and reaped three times in a year, on the same 
piece of land with little injury to the crop. As fast as the water rises, 
the stalks grow, so that the ear is never immersed; inasmuch as those 
experienced in such matters have taken the measure of a single night’s 
growth as six cubits.’ 

There may be a slight exaggeration here but we know that this variety of 
rice is still grown in certain parts of Assam and Bengal. 

Another point to note here is that agriculturists by using selection 
method had classified rice into varieties and utilized the different varieties 
to suit different environmental conditions. In view of the past history of 
rice cultivation in India, one wonders whether the experience of rice culti- 
vation for such a long time is not responsible for an advanced knowledge 
in this cereal. 

Barley 

Jgu (jav) {Hordeum vulgare L.) was usually cultivated where wheat was 
grown. There was no barley cultivation in Bengal and Assam. Generally 
speaking, the proportion of wheat and barley cultivation was 3:1. According 
to Ain, about 1/5 of the entire land under cultivation was covered by barley. 

Millets 


Under the general term millet, many small-grained cereals are cultivated, 
mostly in the drier parts of the country. During Akbar’s time tax was 
imposed on the following millets:

Of these, almost all are cultivated at the present time.® A point to 
note here is that these small cereals were cultivated in those days because 
either they were eaten by the poorer sections of people or they were used 
as fodder. It is most likely that the latter was the case, because it is re- 
peatedly mentioned that pasture covered extensive area of the land. For 
instance in Bengal, where there are now few pasture lands, an extensive area 
was cultivated for fodder and ‘ghee* was available in abundance. Accord- 
ing to J. Xavier,** in Agra region ‘butter with rice, millet and pulses formed 
the food of the common people and there was no one in Agra who did 
not eat it*. 

Another point of our interest is that from all accounts area cultivated 
under bajra at that time was much smaller than what it is today. 

Pulses 

Under the name pulses come a number of leguminous seeds which 
are eaten as a source of vegetable protein. During Akbar’s reign many 
of these were grown and tax was collected on their production. These 
are given below with their Persian, Hindusthani and English, and Latin 
names:

also mentioned. Toreya is Brassica campestris L. var. toria Dutt and 
Full, while mustard includes a number of species and varieties, such as 
B. compestris L. var. dichotoma Watt, the kalisarson; B. compestris L. var.

B.juncea (L.) Czem and Coss, rai; B. napus L., the kalisarson, and B, nigra 
Koch, the kalirai. It is quite possible that the entire lot of oil-yielding 
mustards was grouped together at that time for the purpose of taxation. 
We know now that scientific classification of plants was then absent. 

Cash Crops 

Under cash crops, sugar-cane was extensively cultivated all over the 
country. ‘In Bengal sugar-cane was pre-eminent both in volume of output 
and quality.’® Cultivation of cotton (Gossypium arboreum L.) has been 
reported in smaller areas than that of the sugar-cane. Its cultivation was, 
however, not restricted to the so-called cotton tract, but beyond it. North 
India used to grow cotton in a fairly large quantity. Surprisingly Bengal 
is reported to have produced an important crop of cotton which is not the 
case today. The reason might have been lack of proper transport. Bengal 
was at that time at the height of production of muslin cloth which necessi- 
tated easy accessibility to cotton. During the latter part of the Muslim 
period, indigo (Indigofera tinctoria L.) was an important cash crop in 
great demand for internal use as well as for export.^ Incidentally, this 
dye-yielding plant of the seventeenth century had its own history written 
in volumes in commercial literature of the time. The best quality came 
from Bayana tract near Agra. Inferior quality grew in the Doab, Khurja 
and Koli (Aligarh). A place called Sarkheja, near Ahmedabad, has also 
the reputation of producing good quality indigo. The indigo grown in the 
south (Telingana) was considered to be of medium quality. In fact, indigo 
plantation was quite common from Bengal to Khandesh. Of interest from 
a scientific point of view is that with the disappearance of cultivation of 
indigo, its adverse effect on the fertility of soil for growing wheat and other 
spring crops was realized. We now know about the nitrogen fixation 
ability of the roots of indigo plant but in the sixteenth and seventeenth 
centuries this knowledge was not available. But all the same cultivators 
did realize that something went wrong with the soil if indigo was not grown. 
Another dye-yielding plant was known during Akbar’s time. It was called 
al {Morinda tinctoria Roxb.) and produced a red dye. Cultivation of both 
these plants was stopped when use of synthetic dyes came into vogue. 

Henna or mehndi (Lawsonia inermis L.) is another dye-yielding plant 
that was taxed during Akbar’s reign. Leaves of this plant are crushed 
into a thick paste and applied by women and girls on their hands and feet. 
When removed after half an hour or so, hand and feet retain a red colour. 
This is still the practice in villages, while the women of the urban area use 
modem nail-paints. Again, pan (Piper betle L.), which is chewed along with 
areca nut (Areca catechu L.) and other ingredients, was taxed by the Emperor.

Gardens 

Much has been written about the Mughal gardens by both Indians 
and foreigners but before the Mughals came into the scene considerable 
attention had been paid by the kings of Delhi Sultanate and the Hindu 
kings. Babur’s remarks® on this aspect of Indian culture, when he reached 
Delhi, seem to be in indiscordance with the available facts. That his son 
Humayun appreciated the layout of gardens and buildings of Bengal to 
make him overstay there is enough proof against Babur’s remarks. Akbar 
and his successors made many improyements in this respect at Delhi and 
Agra and these gardens even now are considered worth visiting by Indians 
and foreigners. 

Gardens at that time contained not only flower plants but also fruit 
trees. The latter used to bring a considerable income to the exchequer. 
We also know of the renowned imperial gardens at Agra where all sorts of 
exotic trees were planted and maintained under the personal supervision of 
the emperors. 

Introduction of Plants 

Books on Indian economic plants give many plants which have been 
introduced in the country from outside. It is not always possible to find 
out when and by whom each of these plants was introduced. There are, 
however, records available indicating when a few of them were introduced 
during the Muslim period. Mention has already been made of cherry 
(Prunus avium L.) which was introduced in Kashmir from Persia during 
Akbar’s time. Tobacco {Nicotiana tabacum L.) came to India from 
South America via Arabia. Pilgrims from south India are said to have 
brought it with them when they returned home after Haj. Tobacco was 
introduced in north India during Akbar’s time when one of his lieutenants 
in the south brought this as a present for the Emperor. Akbar did 
not indulge in tobacco-smoking except for once. His son Jahangir passed 
orders for the prohibition of tobacco. But it was an ineffective royal 
order; people went on smoking but not publicly. Gradually its cultivation 
spread from west to east and south to north. 

Another important plant introduced in the country was pineapple 
(Ananas cosmus (L.) Merr.) by the Portuguese in the west coast during the 
sixteenth century. It became a very popular fruit to grow. Its cultivation 
spread rapidly from Gujarat to Bengal. During Jahangir’s time many 
thousands of this plant were grown in the imperial garden at Agra. To 
do this an artificial, moist tropical environment had to be developed — m 
rather expensive affair. Other South American plants of importance 
introduced about this time were papaya (Carica papaya L.) and cashewnut 
(Anacardium occidentalis L.), but the spread of their cultivation was much 
slower than that of the pineapple. It was only in the seventeenth century

The Dutch in Malabar (1667-1750) 

The Dutch East India Company in Malabar (1667-1750) had some men 
who took considerable interest in the vegetation of the area they were 
working in. Of these, Heinrich Van Rheede tot Draakenstein, who was 
appointed Governor of the Dutch possessions in 1667, was a keen botanist. 
During 1674 and 1675 he collected specimens of plants with the help of 
the local people and sent them to Cochin, where drawings were prepared 
by Mathaeus. Corresponding descriptions were written in Malabar 
language, which were first translated into West European language and then 
to Latin. This work by Van Rheede was published between 1686 and 
1703 at Amsterdam in 12 folio volumes with 794 plates. Sir William Jones 
referred to the publication as interesting. He said, ‘When we complain, 
and myself as much as any, that we have leisure in India for literary and 
philosophical pursuits, we should consider that Van Rheede was a noble- 
man at the head of an Indian government and that he fully discharged all 
the duties of his important station, while he found leisure to complete 
those 12 large volumes, which Linnaeus himself pronounces accurate.’ 

Another important work, which originated from this Dutch settlement, 
was the writing by George Everhard Rumphius. The manuscript was 
written in Dutch and remained in the possession of the Dutch Company 
for many years. Then Professor John Burman of Amsterdam rescued it. 
After editing, it was published in 1757 in six volumes. Latin translation 
was provided and it contained 696 plates. 

Paul Herman was appointed under Van Rheede for botanical work 
and was posted in Ceylon. Herman’s plant collection went to Leiden and 
was worked out by him. The results were published in 1717 entitled 
Herman’s Museum Zeylanicum. Later in 1737, John Burman published 
his Thesaurus Zeylanicus based on Herman’s specimens. Herman’s her- 
barium was rediscovered by M. Gunthar, an apothecary to the king of 
Denmark, who sent it to Linnaeus. In 1747 Linnaeus published Flora 
Zeylanica in which he described new genera and included Malabari and 
Sinhalese names. This is an example of restoration of learning of the 
eighteenth century. 

Protestant Mission in the Dutch Settlement in Tranquebar (1668-1834) 

There was another centre of Dutch activity in India on botany. In 
1768 John Gerard Koenig was appointed at the Tranquebar Mission in 
south. He was a missionary surgeon and had his early training in Uppsala

in Sweden under Linnaeus. Koenig was an enthusiastic collector of natural 
science products. He not only made a serious study of the flora of Madras 
coast but also sent dry plants to Sir Joseph Banks and his teacher Linnaeus. 
The latter gave special place to these plants in his herbarium. 

It must be pointed out here that Koenig was the first botanist who 
introduced Linnaean system of classification of plants in India. Before this 
the classification was mainly based on uses of plants without giving serious 
consideration to how flowers and other parts were arranged in a plant. 

Missionaries gathered round Koenig’s ‘United Brotherhood’, a society 
established for the promotion of botanical studies in India. Members of 
the Brotherhood included many missionaries of Tranquebar such as Heyne, 
Klein, Rottlcr, William Roxburgh, William Jones and Buchanan Hamilton. 

Koenig, after 10 years with the Mission, transferred his services to the 
Nawab of Arcot and then to the East India Company. He was sent to 
Siam and the Malay Peninsula to ascertain if Siamese cardamom could be 
grown in south India. He became ill and retired in 1785. 

Systematic botanical investigations were continued later by several 
European naturalists in dilTerent parts of India. Of them, special mention 
may be made of William Roxburgh, William Carey, Nathaniel Wallich 
and George King. The Royal Botanic Garden came into being as early as 
1787 through the efforts of Robert Kyd. The part played by this garden, 
botanical investigations in the nineteenth century, the formation of the 
Botanical Survey of India and related matters are discussed in chapter 10.

Ancient Indians, like their contemporaries in the West, had collected 
considerable information about the living world, although their efforts in 
this field have generally passed unnoticed in books on the history of biology 
by such modern authors as Nordenskiold, Locy, Bodenheimer and several 
others. One of such modern historians of biology remarks: ‘The civilized 
peoples of Eastern Asia, the Hindus and Chinese, have likewise contributed 
very little of importance to the development of the science of biology. 
Hindu Science, indeed, especially in the sphere of mathematics, reached a 
high standard . . We believe that remarks and opinions of this kind, 
due probably to the lack of knowledge of Sanskrit and other classical 
languages of India on the part of Western historians of biology, now require 
revision. We have abundant evidence, albeit scattered in archaeological 
and literary records, of the interest and curiosity of ancient Indians in the 
living world around them leading to a large mass of facts and ideas com- 
paring favourably with similar efforts made contemporaneously by peoples 
of other culture areas of the world. 


PREHISTORIC PERIOD 

Neolithic Haematite Drawings of Animals 

The earliest concrete evidence of interest in animal life is furnished by 
the ‘ruddle’ or ‘haematite drawings* in caves or sheltered rocks, made by 
the neolithic men in India (Fig. 8.1). That these neolithic dwellers of the 
subcontinent, out of sheer necessity for existence, must have acquired 
familiarity with animals and plants is self-evident. Keen naturalists as 
they were, they must have memorized shapes and forms of animals hunted

species of animals associated with the lives of prehistoric peoples. The 
total number of species identified is 92. Mammals represented by 41 
species top the list. Next in order are molluscs represented by 31 species, 
including some marine and land forms and reptiles by 12 species, while 
fishes and birds, of which only five and two species respectively have so far 
come to light, are scantily represented. Barring molluscs, the only other 
invertebrate occurring at Mohenjo-daro (but not reported from other 
places) is coral, Favia fabus (Forskal). For a full list of species, Nath’s 
work may be consulted.® We shall, however, restrict our remarks to a 
brief discussion of the faunal characteristics. 

The rich yield of animal remains comes from Mohenjo-daro and 
Harappa. Sewell and Guha*' have listed 37 species from Mohenjo-daro, 
while Prashad^ has identified 30 species from the remains obtained from 
Harappa, among which many are common to both sites. 

The identified mammals from prehistoric animal remains fall under 
three major categories, viz. domestic, semi-domestic or the wild forms 
habitually associated with vicinities of human dwellings, and wild beasts. 

1 he domestic animals are the humped cattle, buffalo, horse, domestic 
ass, sheep, goat, elephant, camel, pig, dog and cat. Of birds, remains of 
only two species are known with certainty; the fowl was definitely domesti- 
cated and the black partridge might have been so. The presence of so 
many domestic species in prehistoric India is not surprising. It is now 
universally accepted that the domestication of animals either preceded or 
went side by side with the transition of man from a nomadic hunting and 
root-gathering stage to a farming one. The people had already taken to 
agriculture and had domesticated the species mentioned above. The com- 
monest domestic animals whose remains have turned up at several pre- 
historic sites in India were the humped cattle, buffalo, sheep, goat and pig. 
The elephant seems to have been tamed fairly early as its remains have 
been found at both Harappa and Mohenjo-daro. The ass was a common 
domestic animal but not everywhere. The horse appears to have come 
into the picture later as its remains are not found in the earlier stratifications. 
This animal was very popular among the later Aryans who used it for 
drawing chariots, for riding and as a sacrificial animal. The dog and the 
cat are not plentifully represented, though they might have been popular. 
There are archaeological indications that the people of Harappa were 
familiar with at least two kinds of dogs, one of which, a mastiff, had been 
a locally restricted breed (Fig. 8.2). 

Of the remains of other animals so far found, which were not truly 
domesticated in the economic sense but moved freely among human 
settlements or at their outskirts in prehistoric times, mention may be made 
of the rat, the mongoose and the shrew. The jackal and the wolf had been 
the prowlers in forests or scrubs skirting the inhabited areas.

The wild life apparently familiar to these people consisted of the 
elephant, rhinoceros, wolf, jackal, nilgai, gaur (Indian bison), bulfalo 
and a few species of deer like the hangul or Kashmir stag (whose horns

and chital, specially the last, were fairly widespread as their remains had 
been found in several prehistoric and historic sites from different parts of 
India. 

The abundant molluscs which included many marine forms like Xancus 
(Chank shell) and Area (Arc shell), etc., were apparently used for food 
(along with the domestic animals) as well as for ornamental purposes. The 
remains of bangles and their fragments at Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, 
and cores of shells from which these had been sawn off, point to the existence 
of a well-developed bangle industry at those sites. Possibly several species 
of turtles recovered at many sites might also have served ornamental pur- 
poses in addition to fulfilling the dietary requirements. 

Among the 12 species of reptiles, eight belong to tortoises and turtles 
in seven genera, while the remaining ones are the crocodile, gharial and two 
species of monitor lizards. 

Fishes are scantily represented and their remains do not furnish their 
identity with certainty. There are carp and other ‘teleostean’ remains, 
Rita rita and Wallago sp., both freshwater forms, and Arius sp., an estuarine 
fish. The scantiness of fish remains, however, may not indicate paucity 
or lack of interest in fish. There is definite evidence, furnished by the un- 
earthing of several fish-hooks from these sites, which indicate that angling 
was a common pastime, as also the netting of fishes.® 

Strangely enough, no remains of the tiger and lion are found though 
the former was by no means uncommon to the Harappans as we shall sec 
later. The occurrence of rhinoceros remains at Harappa and Mohenjo- 
daro is interesting indeed. It has also been discovered at Lothal in Gujarat 
and formed the subject of neolithic haematite drawings in Mirzapur. The 
distribution of this dweller of marshy forest lands is now severely restricted, 
though only in historic times it was hunted by the Mughal Emperor Babur 
at Peshawar in the former North-West Frontier Province of undivided India. 
Judged from the archaeological finds and from references in the Vedic and 
the Puranic texts, it is apparent that rhinoceros was a fairly common animal 
in certain parts of India until recent historic times. 

The animal remains dug up from the prehistoric sites give concrete 
evidence of the association of the people with the animal world and of the 
extent to which these were harnessed in the service of man. Some idea as 
to the impact of animal life on the prehistoric Indian culture and on the 
thought processes of these people can also be gathered from the glyptic 
art represented on seals, paintings on pottery and animal figurines and toys. 

Large numbers of steatite seals excavated from Harappa and Mohenjo- 
daro bear engravings of animals in profile with inscriptions in a pictographic 
script still remaining undeciphered. Some of the animals depicted— the 
unicorns and chimaeras — are apparently mythical, but others are immedi- 
ately recognizable as beasts obviously familiar to the artists of those times.

been executed are indeed commendable, specially the humped bull, in which 
even the wrinkles on shoulders and dewlaps have been faithfully reproduced. 

The recognizable animals on seals from Mohenjo-daro, according to 
Mackay, are the short-horned bull (a smaller humpless breed), zebu or

Indian humped bull or brahminy bull (Bos indicus), buffalo (Buhalus 
bubalis), elephant (Elephas maximus\ Indian one-horned rhinoceros (Rhino- 
ceros unicornis), tiger (Panthera tigris), gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) and 
antelope (blackbuck ?). Further excavations from the same site have also 
unearthed a few seals with engravings of a frog (?), the chinkara or Indian 
gazelle (Gazelle gazelle bennetti) and the goat (Capra hircus aegragus)^' 
(Fig. 8.3). 

Majority of the seals excavated from Harappa^ bear engravings 
identical with those from Mohenjo-daro, but on some are carved animal 
forms not represented at the former site. These are the gaur or Indian 
bison (Bos gaurus), eagle (?) (Fig. 8.4) and a hare (?). In addition, miniature 
seals representing the gharial, fish and tortoise are also available from 
Harappa. 



Fig. 8.4. Representation of animals on seals of Harappa. A, gaur; B, eagle (?) 
(after Vats, 1940). 

Judging from the frequency of reproduction on seals, it seems that 
among the recognizable animals the most popular (next to unicorn) are 
the bulls which are represented both by a smaller, short-horned, humpless 
variety (only found in the seals at Mohenjo-daro) and by the brahminy 
bull or the Indian humped cattle. The short-horned bull is invariably 
carved in a characteristic stance, the head lowered and slightly twisted to 
one side, as if in an angry mood and just about to charge.® In most cases 
the heavy wrinkles on shoulders, and sometimes the dewlaps, are also 
reproduced with great fidelity. The sureness of touch with which these 
are executed leaves no doubt as to the identity of the zebu. The elephant, 
next to the bull in order of popularity, was certainly tamed by the Indus

Valley people, and has been represented on the seals by two types, one 
with flat back, square head and stout legs, and the other less heavily built 
and with a sloping head. 

Among the wild animals only the tiger, rhinoceros, gaur, blackbuck (?) 
and chinkara appear to have impressed the Indus Valley artists sufficiently 
to warrant a place on the seals. The tiger, fairly well-represented, is of 
special interest on two seals, where the animal is depicted as standing 
below a tree, tail curled up and turned behind intently watching a man 
perched safely above on the tree (Fig. 8.3F). Apparently, such a scene 
might not have been an unusual one during those days. 

Many animals are shown along with a manger, or tethered, indicating 
domestication or a state of captivity. The accuracy with which several 
animals are depicted on the seals reveals the intimate acquaintance of the 
artist with them, an acquaintance which could have been resulted only 
from close and sustained observations, and from a real understanding of 
the animal life. 

A remarkable feature is the non-representation of the cow on the seals. 
The animal was surely as abundant as the bull, yet there is not one figure 
depicting it. In strange contrast to this, as we shall see further on, the 
cow assumed importance among the Aryans who inhabited India in later 
times. Similarly, the absence of the lion, another well-known animal of 
the Vedic Indians, is conspicuous. It is difficult to explain why it is so; 
perhaps it may have something to do with their traditional beliefs rather 
than zoology. 

Turning to the other forms of animal representations, we find the list 
of species further enhanced by the figurines, toys and paintings on pottery. 
Animal figurines are found in large number, apparently made as toys for 
children, containing some curious inconsistencies like the hare with a long 
tail or cattle with a truncated tail. As on seals, the most popular objects 
for figurines are the short-horned bull and the brahminy bull, followed 
by the rhinoceros. The ram, not depicted on the seals, appears to be 
popular as figurines. 

Animals represented through this form of art at Mohenjo-daro are 
the two kinds of bulls, rhinoceros, dog, mastiff, elephant, gharial, hare, 
monkey, turtle, antelope (blackbuck ?), horse (?), pig (rare), sheep, goat, 
buffalo and other unidentified species. Birds like the dove, domestic 
fowl, peacock, bunting (?), duck and goose are also represented® (Fig. 8.5). 

The Harappa toys, as Vats^ has pointed out, contain representations 
of the two bulls, rhinoceros, goat and ram. The tiger (which is found 
only on the seals in Mohenjo-daro), elephant and pig are also depicted. 
The monkey and possibly the cat were also known and squirrels and reptiles

The artistic representations of animals, associated with pottery, start 
coming up in archaeological finds belonging to pre-Harappan cultures in 
India. The excavations made by the Archaeological Survey of India at 
Kalibangan, Ganganagar district, Rajasthan, are specially interesting in this 
context. The animal motifs represented on pottery from this site include 
some excellent, stylized figures of the blackbuck, chinkara (?), and an in- 
complete, but otherwise highly realistic drawing of a duck (Fig. 8.7).^*

Another unique feature in this pottery is the representation of a spider 
and scorpion, two ubiquitous creatures of India, which do not find place 
in any other ware excavated so far from different parts of India. 

The decorations found on pottery from Harappa and Mohenjo-daro 
as well as from other areas of the north-west, like Rana Ghundai, Nal, 
etc., contain several animal motifs and panels depicting natural scenery

with animal and plant life. Animal designs on Mohenjo-daro pottery 
include the ibex (which must have been fairly well known to the inhabitants 
there), antelope, jackal, bird, snake and lizard (perhaps the monitor). 
Figures on faience wares depict the dove, parakeet, peacock, masks of a 
panther-like animal, squirrel (seated on its haunches with forepaws in the 
mouth, as if eating), mongoose, hare, elephant, monkey, humped bull and 
the short-horned bull. 

Harappa wares also display similar representations of animals. In 
addition, many sherds with plain and painted pottery show decorative 
panels with animal motifs (Fig. 8.8). Thus, a decorated pot shows two 
goats, a highly conventionalized representation of a peacock and a grass- 
hopper between the feet of one of the goats. Another ware depicts a she- 
goat suckling her young and a peacock, while a third one shows a peacock 
holding a plant in its beak and some crude caricatures of small birds.

Examples of decorated pottery with naturalistic representations are 
available from other prehistoric sites adjoining Harappa-Mohenjo-daro 
culture in Baluchistan. 

The Kulli wares from Kolwa in south Baluchistan contain natural 
representations of animals and plants on a frieze between zones of non- 
reprcsentational motifs. ‘The frieze represents a standard scene, in which 
two animals, usually humped cattle but sometimes felines, dominate in 
grotesquely elongated form, a landscape with formalized trees and some- 
times ancillary rows of diminutive, very stylized goats.’® 

Some very interesting pottery remains with fish paintings executed 
in polychrome have been excavated from Nal (Jhalawan Division of 
Kalat Stale, Baluchistan). Hora*' has attempted to identify the fishes 
represented on the 4,000-year-old Nal ware, which he assigns to seven 
genera, namely Garra, Crossochilus, Cyprinon, Tor, Newachilus, Botia and 
Glyptothorax (Fig. 8.9). The attempted identification is indeed a tribute to 
the Nal artists for realistic accuracy. If Hora’s identifications are correct.

and they appear to be so, the pottery fish designs may throw some light on the 
climatic conditions then prevailing in Baluchistan. Hora rightly concludes 
that Baluchistan, now an arid area, might have had more rainfall and 
voluminous perennial streams during those times, since at least three of the 
fish motifs on the pottery represent genera which live in such streams.

No account of animals that caught the attention of prehistoric Indians 
can be complete without a reference to the mythical forms, specially the 
‘unicorn’, depicted on seals from Harappa and Mohenjo-daro (Fig. 8.10A).

first exploration® depict this fabulous animal indicates the importance it 
might have had in the traditional beliefs of these peoples. Use of animal 
symbols as totems is known throughout the world since the beginning of 
human cultures and animals have indeed played a very important role in 
conditioning certain aspects of instinctive behaviour in man. No wonder, 
this mythical animal — the unicorn (so called for want of a better name) — 
dominated the glyptic art of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, though the 
reasons for this may never be known until one could decipher the script on 
the seals. The unicorn, always depicted in profile like other totems, is a 
male beast with one horn, body of a heavily-built antelope or of an ox 
with a long tufted tail. The horn is either smooth or transversely ridged 
(so unlike that of an ox) and the ears are long and pointed (as in antelopes). 
Apparently it is a composite animal belonging to the realm of legends. 
Indian mythological lore abounds in such fabulous creatures. Besides the 
unicorn, there are chimerical beasts represented on some seals. One such 
seal depicts a human figure with hoofs, horns and tail of a bison (Fig. 8.10B). 
Another has a fantastic figure of a ram and horns of a bull on human face 
with trunk and tusks of an elephant and hindquarters of a tiger (Fig. 8. IOC). 
A three-headed beast with head and horns of an antelope joined to the 
body of a unicorn adorns one seal (Fig. 8.10D), in which one head is in eating 
posture, another is looking forward, and third is looking backward in 
(apparent) alarm. Furthermore, there is the ‘triskillion’, three tigers with 
bodies crossing each other in the centre (Fig. 8.10E). Finally, one damaged 
seal shows heads and necks of six animals radiating from a ring-like motif 
(Fig. 8.10F); of the four unbroken heads, one is of a unicorn, another of a 
short-horned bull, the third is of an antelope and the fourth of a tiger, the 
remaining two heads probably represent an elephant and a rhinoceros. 

The above picture of the animals of prehistoric India, built up from 
their actual remains and representations through glyptic art, decorative 
pottery and figurines, points out to the climatic conditions that might 
have been prevalent in north-west India, the seat of the Harappan 
culture that flourished some 4,300 years ago. The present climatic 
conditions in the Panjab and Sind are hardly suitable for the type of 
fauna that this tract supported in prehistoric times. The archaeological 
finds, specially the kiln-dried bricks utilized in building the Mohenjo-daro 
and Harappa settlements, also indicate the presence of large stretches of 
highly wooded areas rich in water resources and teeming with a large variety 
of wild life including the tiger, the elephant, the rhinoceros and the buffalo. 

HISTORICAL PERIOD 

With the advent of the Aryans and the development of the Vedic 
literature, prehistory passes into history in India. Animal world, to the 
Vedic people, was not a separate entity, but a part of the great cosmic 


Mackay (2), p. 382. 



ZOOLOGY

system embracing the whole world. Biological phenomena, therefore, are 
not separately treated but, along with other cosmic phenomena, are diffused 
throughout the Vedic and classical literature. Sifting through this vast 
. mass of literature spread over centuries, a difficult but rewarding exercise, 
reveals that the ancient Indians were keen observers of the living world, 
amassing facts of natural history, speculating upon the nature and origin 
of life, attempting to classify living beings into rational groups based on 
the modes of reproduction, ways of living or dietary values. Their ana- 
tomical, physiological, embryological and genetical observations, however, 
were chiefly based on their knowledge about man. The only other animals 
receiving similar treatment were the cattle, horse and elephant, that is, 
animals of economical or military importance. 

ANIMALS AND NATURAL HISTORY 

Natural history is probably the most appropriate term to express the 
observations recorded by the ancient Indians. Though animal names were 
galore in ancient texts, the science of naming animals had not achieved the 
status of taxonomy. Animals were observed and named simply for 
recognition. Several animal names have been based on some structural 
peculiarities or some distinct traits in habits, making recognition easy. 
However, these names arc not accompanied by any descriptive details which 
can be taken as an aid to identification. Nevertheless, a good many animals 
mentioned in the ancient texts have been identified with species known 
today, because their names have passed on through centuries without any 
change or as easily reconcilable derivatives and are still in use in different 
parts of India. 

Observations on habits and habitats of several animals have been 
recorded in the sacerdotal and lyrical works. The impact of Nature on the 
creative faculties of the poets of olden days has received wide acclaim for 
their beauty and vividness. 

Samhitds, Brdhmanas and Upanisads 

The Samhitds, the Brdhmanas, the Aranyakas-Upanisads contain several 
names of animals as well as observations on their habits and habitats. 
Macdonell and Keith® have compiled a list of over 260 animal names used 
in the Vedic literature. Rao^ has also dealt with Vedic animals while 
recording the knowledge of Indian fauna through the ages. The majority 
of animals listed therein comprise mammals and birds, while reptiles 
(chiefly serpents), fishes and insects are not numerous. The Yojurveda 
and the Atharvaveda are, in particular, full of animal names. The Yajurveda 
provides a list of animal victims in the ahamedha with the horse, as the 
name of the ritual implies, occupying the place of honour. In the Atharva. 
veda, snakes and worms (krmi) are mentioned in some details. The

Atharvan priest, in giving a series of charms against snake-poison, 
describes different types of snakes as follows: 

‘O kairdta, speckled one, upatrnya (grass-dweller), brown 
one listen to me; ye black repulsive reptiles, (listen to 
me) ! . . .’ 

‘I release (thee) from the fury of the black serpent, the 
taimata the brown serpent, . . 

‘Both dligi and viligi, both father and mother, we know 
your kin everywhere . . 

‘The daughter of uruguld, the evil one born with the 
black — of all those who have run to their hiding-place 
the poison is devoid of force.’ 

‘The prickly porcupine, tripping down from the mountain, 
did declare this: “whatsoever serpents, living in ditches, 
are here, their poison is most deficient in force’’.’® 

The toxic effects of snake-poison are described with prescription of neces- 
sary chants to destroy them. The importance of snakes was obvious and 
a special seknee—sarpavidya — formed an important and recognized 
branch of knowledge from Vedic times. 

Sixteen types of krmis, the obnoxious worms, are mentioned in the 
Atharvaveda} These were regarded as poisonous and spoken of as found 
in the mountains, forests and in the human body. These were believed to 
cause diseases of cattle and man. In man, the worms infested the head 
and ribs and crept into the eyes, nose and teeth. These were described 
as having dark brown bodies, white in the forepart, with black ears and 
three heads ! 

Twenty-eight arthropod names are listed in the Vedic literature, mostly 
referring to insects, in addition to a few scorpions and spiders. These 
include ants, bees, cochineal insects, flies, mosquitoes, fireflies and locusts. 
The depredations caused by the locust to crops were well known, and a 
few names indicate vermins damaging grains and seeds. Caterpillars and 
grasshoppers were also distinguished. There is also a reference to crabs. 

Of other invertebrates, pearl and conch-shells (Mollusca) are mentioned. 

The vertebrates figure pre-eminently in the Vedic literature. Seven 
fish-names appear in the texts, but it is not certain whether these names 
refer to individual species or to a group as a whole. 

Among the reptiles, snakes, as mentioned earlier, figure prominently, 
and about 29 names are used to denote various types, some of which are 
doubtless group-names. Other reptiles include the gharial, chameleon, 
monitor lizard and tortoise. 

Birds and mammals occupy a prominent place in the Vedic literature. 
Several species of birds, many of them recognizable, have been listed. 
These include common forms like the sparrow, myna, parakeet, cuckoo,

pigeon, etc., birds of prey like the vulture, hawk, eagle, owl, aquatic and 
semi-aquatic forms like the heron, stork, curlew, ducks, geese, swan, and 
several others. 

The mammals known to the Vedic people are of three categories, 
domestic, semi-domestic and wild. Practically all the species represented 
in the Harappa culture were known, not surprisingly, because the advent 
of the Aryans did not make any change in the wild life then extant. The 
domestic animals were the cow, buffalo, elephant, horse, camel (not very 
popular), ass, mule, sheep, goat, pig, dog and cat. The jackal and the 
wolf, and possibly the hyena, skirled the forests around human habitations. 
The mongoose and the rat were forms common within and around settle- 
ments. 

Among wild beasts were the carnivores like the lion, tiger, leopard, 
bear, wolf and hyena. The artiodactyls included the antelope, gazelle, 
spotted deer, barasingha, sambhar, etc. There is also mention of others, 
such as the polecat (?), wild boar, monkey, gaur, porcupine, hare and 
pangolin (?), and the rhinoceros and elephant. 

It is rather surprising that the Rgveda does not mention the tiger, a 
beast so familiar to the Harappans and so common in the later samhitds. 
The most popular carnivores in the Rgveda are the wolf and the lion. 
Among the domestic animals, cattle and horse occupy the place of honour; 
and there are plenty of special terms to distinguish different kinds among 
these and their calves and foals. In the later stage of the Vedic period, 
the cow became a very important animal; it was sanctified and its slaughter 
had been prohibited (except on certain special occasions), a decree that has 
been so faithfully honoured by the Hindus of all castes even to this day. 

The mythology and legends of the Vedic period have been considerably 
influenced by animals. Many animals, specially the horse and also the 
kine, goat and deer, figure as the mounts of gods or drawing their luminous 
cars through the air. The importance of the cow in the Vedic and post- 
Vcdic literature has already been mentioned. In the ritual of sacrifice, the 
most common practice to appease the galaxy of gods, animals (of several 
types) figure prominently. The serpent, as a noxious creature, is one of 
the most conspicuous animals, specially as the foe of Indra, appearing in 
the form of a demon. Many birds are alluded to as bringing bad omen or 
good luck. 

The ethology of animals did not escape the attention of the Vedic 
bards. In fact, many animal names take after some peculiar traits either 
in their structures or in their habits. 

The Indian python, frequently referred to in the sacred and mytho- 
logical lores, is the ajagar (the swallower of goats). The Indian koel’s 
habit of depositing its eggs in the nests of other birds is noticed, and the 
Vdjasaneyl and the Maitrdyanl Samhitds call this bird anya-vdpa which 
means sowing for others; its other name parabhrta also connotes its 
parasitic habits. The spiders are called urnandbhay meaning wool in the

navel, an appellation no doubt inspired by the way in which the material 
forming its web comes out of the abdomen. 

The cock is kukkuta, an onomatopoeic word, suggesting the sound 
emanated by its crowing. Several references are made in the Rgveda and 
Satapatha Brahmana to the casting of slough by serpent. Mention is made 
in the Atharvaveda and l^atapatha Brahmana of peculiar movements of 
snakes, earning the name of Datvati rajju or ‘toothed rope’.® Similar lines 
are also found in the Aitareya Aranyaka. The poisonous character of 
snake-bite is frequently mentioned in the Rgveda and other satnhitas. 
The Atharvaveda mentions the torpidity of snakes in winter when they 
creep into the earth, a phenomenon now well known as hibernation. The 
mongoose (nakuld) has been regarded as the deadly enemy of snakes and 
immune to their poison by the use of a healing plant, perhaps a blind belief 
that still persists among our people. 

The carnivorous beasts, the lion and the tiger, were dreaded for their 
dangerousness. The roaring (nada) of the lion is compared to the thunder 
in the Vedic texts. The king of beasts, as it is called, wanders about (kucara) 
and lives in the hills (giristha) and is the terror of other beasts whom he 
slays. The lion, being dangerous to men, was trapped, ambushed or 
chased by hunting bands.^ The tiger, not mentioned in the Rgveda, finds, 
however, a frequent mention in the Atharvaveda which is taken as an evi- 
dence of eastward extension of the Aryan territory during the time when 
it was said to be composed. The destructive nature of this beast is often 
alluded to and it passed, like the lion, as a symbol of strength. Man- 
eating tigers (purirsad) are also mentioned.^ 

The frog is mentioned as the harbinger of rain. The awakening of 
frogs at the beginning of the rainy season inspired an interesting hymn in 
the Rgveda^ graphically re-enacting a scene with which people in India arc 
very familiar. The chorus of the croaking frogs is compared to the chants 
of priests exhilarated by soma and with the clamour of pupils at school 
repeating the words of their teacher. The relevant portion of this hymn 
is quoted below: 

(1) The frogs have lifted up their voice, the voice Parjanya hath 
inspired. 

« The figure of speech ‘toothed rope’, or ‘the rope full of teeth’, is also used in the 
Atharvaveda. Thus ‘on a distant path shall move the biting rope (the serpent) . . .', 
AV., IV, 3,2. The ^atapatha Brahmana has it , for snakes are like rope, and 
snakes’ haunts are like wells (pits) . . .’ {§at. Br., IV, 4.5.3). 

The Rgveda refers to the lion as follows: ‘Exceedingly wise they roar like lions 
mightily’ {RV., I, 64.8); ‘roar as the lions roar’ {RV„ III, 26.5.7); ‘like a dread lion’ 
(jjtk'., IV, 16.14); ‘as a snared lion leaves the trap that caught him’ (RK. X, 28.10). 
‘The forest animals, the wild animals homed in the woods, the man-eating lions 
and tigers that roam’ (AV., XII, 1.49). Elsewhere, ‘Thyself a tiger, dost thou 
upon this tiger-skin stride (victorious) through the great regions’ (AK, IV, 8.4). 
The tiger’s skin was a mark of royalty, as the tiger, and also the lion, was regarded 
as the king of animals.

(2) What time on these, as on a dry skin lying in the pool’s bed, 
the floods of heaven descended, 

the music of the frogs comes forth in concert like the cows 
lowing with their calves beside them. 

(5) When one of these repeats the other’s language, as he who 
learns the lesson of the teacher, 

your every limb seems to be growing larger as ye converse 
with eloquence on the waters. 

(7) As Brahmans, sitting round the brimful vessel, talk at the soma- 
rite of Atiriitra, 

so, frogs, ye gather round the pool to honour this day of all 
the year, the first of rain-time. 

Post-Vedic literature follows the tradition of the Vedas in recording the 
names of animals and some observations on their natural history. As 
food and as offerings for sacrifice, animal life had acquired an important 
status. The sport of hunting which is one of the time-honoured recreations 
and means for obtaining protein food must have assisted in amassing 
observations which gradually accumulated and served as a storehouse of 
knowledge that stimulated thought and developed concepts about classi- 
fication, heredity, embryology, etc. 

Animals in the Epics 

Constant references are made to animals in the two great epics, the 
Ramayana and the Mahahharata. 

Chaudhuri and Roy have provided lists of animals, both aquatic and 
terrestrial, as extant in the Ramayana. They include the commonly known 
mammals, birds, fishes, insects, etc. The aquatic animals are the mytholo- 
gical makora (whose identity is still in dispute), nakra (crocodile, gharial) 
and timi (whale). The insects are indragopa (cochineal), kosakdra (silk- 
worm), damsa (gnat), masaka (mosquito) and sotcarana which literally 
means six feet and can be applied to any insect. The scorpion (yjrmka) 
is also referred to. Fishes have been identified by Hora (1952) as Garra 
mullya (cakraiunda), Mastacembalus armatus {nalamJna), Labeo fimbriatus 
{rohita), Channa striatus (sakula) and Wallago ottu {pdfhlna). There 
are a few names signifying snakes. Birds include the kdrandava (coot), 
kurara (osprey), krauhea (pond heron), cakravdka (brahminy duck), 
koyasiibhas (lapwing), kadamba (purple moorhen), kahka (gray heron), 
gfdhra (vulture), sikhin (peacock), syena (hawk or falcon), ddtyuha (water- 
fowl), madgu (aquatic bird, probably cormorant) and sdrika (a bird of 
doubtful identity). 

The most familiar animal in the Ramayana is indeed the kapi or monkey. 
There was a varied assortment of these creatures variously called golangula, 
gopucchas (probably synonymous with the Indian langur), vanara (similar 
to man and living in forests), plavaga or plavamga (moving by leaps, a 
familiar habit of monkeys when running). The monkey was also known 



422

as sdkhdmrga (an animal living in the branches of trees, obviously referring 
to its arboreal habits). Eleven types of deer are listed in the Rdmdyam, 
some of which are no doubt our common species. 

The Mahdhhdrata is full of references to a large variety of animals, 
many of which are common to Rdmdyam and the Vedic literature. Of 
great interest in this epic is the Astikaparva, which deals with the ndgayajna 
of Janmejaya, a descendant of the Pandavas. Janmejaya, to avenge the 
death of his grandfather Pariksit who was the fatal victim of snake-bite, 
organized a big snake-hunt to decimate the serpent tribe on the earth. In 
connection with this anti-snake ritual, about 170 species of snakes are 
listed. Vedi has compiled a list of snakes mentioned in Indian literature. 
This list enumerates 418 names, of which many are no doubt synonyms. 

The Mahdbhdrala has interesting explanations for the poisonous 
nature of some snakes and their forked tongues (dvijihva). Some snakes 
are poisonous because they licked drops of the haJdhala, deadly poison 
retrieved along with amrta from the primordial sea when it was churned 
by the gods and demons. 

Similarly, the forked tongue of snakes has a mythological explanation. 
The much sought-after vessel of amrta was kept on a bed of sharp-edged 
grass (kusa) under strong guard. The snakes sneaked near the repository, 
crawling unnoticed; their darting tongues were said to be split into two by 
the sharp blades of kusa. 

Animals in the Medical and Miscellaneous Works 

The two great medical works, the samhitds of Caraka and Susruta, give 
an almost complete list of animals of various groups known till then as 
also some details about anatomy, zoological classification, ecology and 
dietary value of animals, and physiology of man. The treatment followed is 
basically similar in the two treatises. While Caraka gives some details about 
parasites, Susruta's spectrum is much wider, embracing leeches, insects, spid- 
ers, scorpions, frogs, fishes, reptiles (specially snakes), birds and mammals. 

Su^ruta’s account of fishes inhabiting various freshwater habitats 
reveals a keen insight into the correlation between the form and locomotion 
of fishes, as Hora" has pointed out. The rudiments of the science of func- 
tional morphology, that is correlation between forms and functions, are 
clearly discernible is Susruta's compendium. 

Ray and Gupta have given an interesting scientific synopsis of the 
Caraka Samhitd with references to Caraka’s zoology. For Susruta, the 
excellent English translation of the Susruta Samhitd in three volumes by 
Kunja Lai Bhishagratna,*' as also ScaFs work, are recommended. 

“ Hora (1), pp. 1-7. 

^ ‘Bhishagratna’ is the Ayurvedic title conferred on the author Kunja Lai Bhaduri. 
On the title-pages of the volumes the prefix ‘Kaviraj’ — a title equivalent to ‘Doctor’ 
as is usually ascribed to medical practitioners — has been used for the author’s name. 
‘Sharma’, used as surname by the author on the dedication page of Vol. 1, is often used 
by the Brahmans.

during this period was the propagation of the creed of ahimsa, i 
reaction against the sacrificial ritual of the Vedic Hindus. Though there 
is no substantial addition to the list of animal names which had already 
gained currency during the period prior to this, there is a distinct change 
in the outlook towards animals. It was decreed that animals should not 
be needlessly slaughtered, though there was no ban on eating meat. For 
the first time we hear about national parks {abhayaranya), where animals 
could move about unmolested. In Kautilya’s Arthasastra, there are 
indications of regulations governing fisheries, livestock, hunting, etc. 

The period preceding the Christian era and a few centuries immediately 
after, witnessed intense philosophical-scientific activities, no doubt activated 
by the Buddhist and Jainist reaction towards orthodox Brahminism (in 
centuries preceding the birth of Christ) and Hindu reaction against Buddhism 
in the following half millennium after the Gregorian Calendar was intro- 
duced. This was the period of Hindu Renaissance, which crystallized the 
different systems of philosophy and produced commendable works on 
mathematics, astronomy, chemistry, physics, botany and zoology. 

In the post-Christian period, specially in the later half of the first 
millennium a.d., some remarkable works on Sanskrit poetry were produced. 
Among these the lyrics and dramas of Kalidasa have received world-wide 
acclamation for the poet’s deep understanding of Nature. As Macdonell, 
while discussing the works of that great poet Kalidasa, aptly remarks about 
Rtusamhara: ‘Perhaps no other work of Kalidasa's manifests so strikingly 
the poet’s deep sympathy with Nature, his keen powers of observations, his 
skill in depicting the Indian landscape in vivid colours.’" This is true indeed 
not only of Kalidasa but also of many other Sanskrit poets and dramatists. 

Animals and plants figure prominently in Kalidasa’s poetry, details 
about which can be seen in Law’s book^ on the birds of Kfilidasa, and in 
various articles by Gupta^ dealing with birds and insects mentioned by the 
poet. His understanding of animal life can be easily gauged by an account of 
summer in Rtusamhara, in which the effects of heat on animal life are vividly 
portrayed by the thirst or lethargy that it produces in serpent, lion, elephant, 
buffalo, boar, gazelle, peacock, crane, frog and fish; and the devastation 
caused by forest fire is graphically described as the tongues of flame devour 
trees and shrubs and drive before them crowds of terror-stricken beasts. 

Varahamihira, the great encyclopaedist, did not fail to mention nature 
and animals in his Brhatsamhita, in which he has extensively described the 
cow, dog, cock, tortoise, goat, horse and elephant in separate sections. 

The Amarakosa, a great lexicographic work by Amar Singha, gives 
meanings, synonyms and definitions (at places) of practically all animal names 
in the Vedic and post-Vedic texts. For a list of animal names current during 
and before this great lexicon (as important as Panini’s grammar), one can 
unhesitatingly refer to this work. Though not zoological by any means, 
the animals have been listed according to their habitats as well as habits.

Classification of Animals 

The Rgveda does not furnish any indication of classification of animals 
other than the division of common mammals into two groups, viz. the 
domestic forms (gramya) and those living in forests {dranya), the wild 
animals. Later in the Atharvaveda we come across the term jagat, moving 
or mobile, to encompass the domestic forms vis-a-vis svapada which include 
the wild ones. Among the domestic forms, the solid-hoofed (ekasapha) 
horse, ass and mule and the split-hoofed {dvisapha) were further distinguished 
from one another by the presence of incisors in both the jaws {ubhayadanta: 
in the Rgveda and later samhitds) and by having incisors in the lower jaw 
only (anyatodanta) as in the cattle and sheep. Man has been included 
among the ubhayadanta, that is with incisors in both the jaws, in a passage 
m the Tailtinya Samhitd. Man as dvipada (biped) was further distinguished 
from the catuspada (quadruped) animals. Mammals were called pasu 
(also mrga later on), birds (pakfi having wings) and reptiles (and perhaps 
other crawling animals) were sarisrpa (the crawlers); snakes were sarpa, 
and insects (and probably their larvae) were klta (non-flying) and patahga 
(winged insects). In the Atharvaveda, as we have already seen, obnoxious 
parasites of man and cattle were called krmi\ possibly all (or at least 
some) of the kinds named were worms parasitizing man and domestic 
animals. 

The first attempt to classify animals in a rational (though not natural) 
way is found in the Chdndogya Upanisad, where they are divided into 
three groups according to the nature of their bfja, literally meaning seed, 
but metaphorically implying mode of origin and development. These 
three groups of animals arc andaja (born from egg), jJvaja (born alive 
or born from womb) and udbhijja (born from sprouts). The Aitareya 
Aranyaka adds one more group, svedaja (born out of sweat), generated by 
hot moisture to comprise flies, worms, etc., which becomes jardyuja in later 
works. Further, the term jivaja of the Chdndogya is replaced by jaruja. 
The term jardyu, used in Atharvaveda in the sense of ‘serpent’s skin’, is 
more frequently used in the later Vedic texts to denote the outer covering 
(chorion) of the embryo as opposed to ulva, the inner covering or amnion 
[Rgveda, VdjasaneyJ Samhitd, Aitareya Brdhmana, ^atapatha Brdhmana, 
etc.). The jaruja ox jardyuja, therefore, comprises placental mammals. 

The Manu Smrti divides the living world into sthdvara (fixed or im- 
mobile plants) and jahgama (the mobile animal world). The animals are 
further classified into three groups, namely (i) jardyuja which includes 
pasu (domestic quadrupeds), mrga (wild herbivores), vydla (wild carnivores), 
ubhayatodanta (with incisors on both jaws), rdksasa, pisdea and man; 
(ii) andaja which includes birds, snakes, crocodiles, fishes, tortoises and 
turtles and similar kinds of terrestrial (sthalaja) and aquatic (audaka) 
animals; and (iii) svedaja which comprises organisms born out of heat and 
moisture of the earth, viz. stinging gnats and mosquitoes [damsa and maiaka), 
lice (yuka), flies, bugs and others. 



426 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


The class t4dhhijja comprises the fixed plant world. Terms such as 
pratuda and viskira came to be used later by Caraka and Susruta for birds, 
the former to indicate those which tear their food with their beaks and the 
latter for those which scatter their food with claws. There is also the use 
of the term pancanakha (five-clawed) which includes hdvit (? pangolin), 
sallaka (porcupine), godha (monitor lizard), khadga (rhinoceros), kurma 
(tortoise) and saki (hare). 

The division of the animal world into four groups according to their 
modes of birth, first made in the Vedic literature, gained wide currency in 
the post-Vedic literature and found frequent mention in the Purdnas and 
the Mahdhharata. Caraka and Susruta both followed this classification in 
their medical treatises. 

According to Caraka® the jardyuja (placental animals) includes man, 
the quadrupeds, etc.; the andaja (egg-born or oviparous) fishes, reptiles 
and birds; the svedaja (born of moisture and heat, i.e. spontaneously or 
asexually reproduced) worms, mosquitoes, etc.; and all animals, born of 
vegetable organisms, are included in the class udhhijja. He further men- 
tions that each yoni has innumerable divisions and consequently the ap- 
pearance, etc., of organisms are also exceedingly varied. 

Panini defines ksiidra jantu as small organisms or animals without 
bones (anasthi) or animals so small that hundreds or even thousands of 
them can be held in the palm of a hand or animals up to the size of the 
mongoose.^^ Patanjali further elaborates the definition of small animals 
(ksudra jantu) as follows: ‘What are ksudra jantul Boneless are ksudra 
jantu. Or those that number more than a thousand in a palmful are 
ksudra jantu. Or those that cannot be easily crushed are ksudra jantu. 
Or animals up to ichneumon (nakula) are ksudra jantu.' 

The definitions of small (or minute) organisms given by Panini and 
Patanjali are, however, defective, since these include boneless and bloodless 
(red blood) creatures up to the size of the mongoose (ichneumon), the 
latter having both bones and blood. Obviously, these are an assemblage 
of small organisms from very minute to those up to the size of ichneumon. 

Prasastapada, the well-known Vaiksika philosopher, divides animals 
into two great divisions : ayonija or animals that are asexually reproduced 
and are of small dimensions (ksudra jantu) of Panini and Patanjali, and 
yonija or sexually reproduced from the union of male and female germ 
elements. The yonija arc further subdivided into jardyuja (man, domestic 
and wild quadrupeds), or viviparous, and andaja, the oviparous animals 
like birds and sarfsi^pa (reptiles, etc.). 

' In Prasastapada’ s own words : 

tatra sarlram dvividham yonijamayonijam ca | t atr ayonija- 
manapeksasukrasonitam . . . | sukrasonitasannipdtajam yo-

He thus modifies the Vedic classification of animals, retaining the an^aja 
and jarayuja and including them in the yonija division (organisms formed 
out of the union of semen and menstrual blood), while including small 
animals into ayonija or asexually reproduced forms. The svedaja and 
udbhijja are not, however, mentioned, because probably the division ayonija 
was developed to include these. Udayana has defined the term jardyu 
as placenta; and the sarJsrpa, according to the same author, includes in- 
sects, fishes, reptiles and snakes. 

Susruta divides animals into four groups, e.g. samsvedaja or svedaja, 
jardyuja, andaja and udbhijja. In various texts the order of enumeration is, 
however, different. Dallana, the commentator of Susruta, defines the 
svedaja as organisms born out of moisture and heat, which are essential 
in generating all forms of animal life. 

Among the examples of the four groupings arc mentioned vydla (car- 
nivorous quadrupeds) and pasu (herbivores) as jarayuja \ birds, snakes and 
sarlsrpas among andaja; I<nw\ kJta and piplhld (worms, insects, ants, etc.) 
among svedaja; frogs and cochineal insect as typifying those that burst 
forth from the ground, the udbhijja.^ Dallana further thinks that these 
divisions are really cross-divisions. He mentions that bats and valdkds 
among birds are viviparous (some valdkds arc oviparous, some are vivi- 
parous). Similarly, among the andaja snakes, ahipaidkd (a kind of non- 
vcnomous snake) is viviparous.^ The same is true of some species of 
ants which lay eggs or burst forth from the ground in the udbhijja way. 

The sarlsrpas together with the birds and snakes are included among 
the oviparous or andaja animals by Susruta, which contain, in the opinion 
of Dallana, fishes and makara (sea-monsters with fierce teeth = ? sharks) 
and also tortoises and crocodiles. 

The same commentator explains that the svedaja organisms are pro- 
duced due to the moisture and heat either of the earth or of the organisms. 
Among these the worms (krmi) arise from the moisture of the faeces in the 
bowels or from putrefying dead bodies, as Gunaratna notes in Tarka- 
rahasya-dlpikd. They may also arise from decomposing milk or curd. 

The moisture-born klta includes scorpions and the six-spotted venom- 
ous insect sadvindu. According to Patanjali (also Susruta in Kalpa- 
sthdna, Ch. VII) scorpions arise from cow-dung, excreta of snakes and 
rotten wood. 

The pipJlikd, that is, ants and the like insects, as Dallana comments, 
have a triple mode of birth; they are born from moisture and heat {svedaja), 
from eggs (andaja) and sometimes burst forth from the ground (udbhijja). 

Sankara (Chandogya Upanisad, Prapdihaka 6, part 3) commenting 
upon the classification of animals, divides them into three groups only, 

" Seal, p. 179. 

^ Although all snakes are oviparous, in some (Viperidac and some other species of 
colubrids) the eggs continue development inside the ‘uterus’ and the young ones are born 
alive. These are examples of ovo-vivipary. Perhaps pallapa observed such cases when 
noting that ahipatakd is viviparous. 



428 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


fivaja (viviparous), andaja and udbhijja. Ankara, like Caraka, agrees that 
udbhijja animals arise from vegetable organisms, but he also holds the view 
that svedaja animals must be included partly under andaja and partly under 
udbhijja. 

SeaP thinks that Sankara’s explanation takes it that, though vegetable 
organisms may pass off into animal, inorganic matter without bJja (seed or 
ovum) cannot give rise to animal life or, in other words, life cannot arise 
de novo, the elementary fact that every student of biology has to learn in 
school. Patanjali, however, believes that not only animal organisms but 
also vegetable organisms, e.g. grasses, can grow from inorganic matter. 
The durva grass is cited as an example; it can grow from deposits of hair 
of goats and cows, just as scorpions are seen to develop from cow-dung. 
Patanjali explains that these are not cases of growth but merely of unfold- 
ing (transformation). 

A different system of classification of animals has been devised by 
Umasvati in the ancient Jaina work, Tattvarthadhigamasutra. Here, the 
number of senses possessed by an organism is taken into account, and the 
animal is placed in an ascending series according to this number. 

1. Those animals which possess two senses — touch and tastc*/^ 

(i) Apadika—yf^orms without appendages. 

(ii) Nupuraka — ring-like with pendants — Annelida. 

(iii) Gandupada—knoXiyAcggcd animals— Arthropoda (including 

Crustacea and Myriapoda). 

(iv) Some kinds of molluscs, such as kmkha (conch), hktika (pearl 

oyster) and sambuka (spiral shell, many snails). 

(v) Jaluka — leeches (Hirudinea). 

2. Animals possessing three senses, viz. touch, taste and smell 

(i) PipJlikd — ants. 

(ii) Rohinikd — red ants. 

(iii) Upaeikd, kimthu, tuburuka — bugs and fleas. 

(iv) TrapusabJJa and karpdsdsthikd — cucumber- and cotton-weevils; 

lice. 

(v) Satapadi and ut pataka — centipede and springtail. 

(vi) Trnapatra — plant-lice. 

(vii) Kdsfhabdraka — ^wood-destroyers, e.g. termites or white ants.

3. Animals with the senses of touch, taste, smell and sight:'' 

(i) Bhramara, varata and saranga — bees, wasps and hornets. 

(ii) Maksikd, puttika, damsa and masaka — dipterous flies, gnats, 

mosquitoes. 

(iii) Vrscika and nandydvart a—scorpions and spiders. 

(iv) Kita-patanga — flying and non-flying insects. 

4. Animals (man and the tiryakyonis) with five well-developed and 
active senses:^ 

(i) Matsya — fishes (Pisces). 

(ii) limbless reptiles including snakes. 

(iii) Bhujanga — limbed reptiles and (?) amphibians. 

(iv) birds (Aves). 

(v) Catuspada — quadrupeds (Mammalia). 

The first three divisions as stated above come under the invertebrates 
and include svedaja and udbhijja of the earlier classifications and the fourth 
includes only vertebrates. 

The fourth is further subdivided into the oviparous and viviparous 
groups: 

(a) Andaja — fishes and reptiles, including sarpa (snakes), godha 

(monitor lizard), krkaldsa (chameleons and garden lizards), 
grhagolika (wall-lizards); matsya (fishes), kurma (tortoise), 
nakra (crocodiles), sisumdra (dolphins and porpoises) and 
lomapaksa paksi (birds with feathered wings).'’ 

Two flaws in this otherwise good classification can be 
noticed. One is the inclusion of dolphins among andaja 
(perhaps their fish-like features and behaviour caused this 
mistake) and the omission of frogs because they were 
traditionally believed to be udbhijja, that is, bursting forth 
from the ground. 

(b) Jardyuja—p\?iQQR{'d\ mammals. Here jardyuja is restricted to 

mean those mammals that have non-deciduate placenta, e.g. 
man, cow, buffalo, goat and sheep, horse, ass, camel, deer, 
yak (chdmara), hog, gavaya (mithun), lion, tiger, bear, panther, 
dog, jackal, cat, etc.*^

(c) Po/fl/a— mammals with deciduate placenta which is thrown off 
as an afterbirth, such as Mlaka (porcupine), hasti (elephant), 
svdvit and Idpaka (hedgehog and other insectivores), sasa 
and sdyikd (hares and squirrels), nakula (mongoose), musika 
(rats and mice), and carmapaksa paksl (birds with leathery 
wings), that is, bats including valguli (flying fox), paksivirala 
(Microchiroptera) and jaluka (apparently meaning blood- 
sucking bats or vampires).® 

Umasvatrs classification, whatever might be its defects from the modern 
point of view, was distinctly a bold advance and excelled contemporary 
efforts made in the western world dominated by Aristotle’s ideas and 
contributions. In fact, in their attempts to introduce systems of classifica- 
tion, the ancient Indians appear to have made much more serious efforts 
to bring together known animals within the bounds of certain rational 
groups and achieved a larger measure of success than did Aristotle. 

In addition to the classification of animals on the basis of their modes 
of reproduction or possession of a series of senses, Caraka and Susruta 
classified animals according to their dietary habits and habitats. Though 
the two systems agree in broad outlines, there are some differences in details 
worthy of notice. 

Caraka’s classification is as follows: 

(1) carnivorous and non-carnivorous animals and birds 
that fall on their food with force. 

(2) Anupa—d,mTm,h that live in marshy or water-logged areas or 

graze on river banks. 

(3) Bhu§aya or vilesaya — subterranean or cave-dwelling animals. 

(4) Vdrisaya — marine and freshwater animals. 

(5) Ju/ucuru— amphibious animals. 

(6) Jangala— mostly species of deer that live in dry and hilly forested 

lands. 

(7) Viskira— birds that scatter their food in picking. 

(8) Pratuda— birds that pierce or tear their food (worms or fruits) 

with beak. 

Su^ruta’s classification begins with two divisions which are further 
subdivided into 13 groups distinguished by natural differences in food and 
habitat. The first two divisions are: (1) jdfigala or animals that five on 
dry hilly country or jungles and (2) anupa, comprising animals that live in 
marshy or water-logged lands (or in water). 

The 13 classes within these two divisions are: 

(1) Jdngala animals: jafighdla, viskira, pratuda, guhasaya, prasaha, 

parnamrga, vilesaya and grdmya. 

(2) animals: kulecara, plava, kosastha, pddina md matsya,

The land animals (jdngala) have three groups exclusively made up of 
birds. These comprise prasaha including birds of prey, like vultures, kites, 
owls, etc., viskira meaning birds that scatter their food while picking up, 
and pratuda, that is, birds that pierce and tear their food. Except that 
Caraka’s prasaha includes birds as well as mammals, the other two groups 
are similar. The remaining five groups of jdngala animals, with the ex- 
ception of several kinds of reptiles included under vilesaya and a few under 
parnamrga, contain mammals. 

The parmmrga, creatures that live in the trees (arboreal animals), are 
apes, monkeys, squirrels, and some reptiles and carnivores. The janghdlas 
are wild deer and antelopes, strong-legged and quick-footed, that run about 
on dry land. The grdinya, living in villages, comprises the horse, mule, 
ass, camel, goat, sheep, cow, etc. They are herbivorous quadrupeds, some 
of which are ekasapha or solid-hoofed. 

The carnivorous beasts like the lion, tiger, wolf, hyena, bear, panther, 
cat, jackal, mrgervdru, etc., comprise guhdsaya that live in natural caves or 
hollows. The wolf {vrka) is defined as a dog-like animal, smaller in size 
than the lion and tiger. 

The animals leading subterranean life in burrows and holes, and there- 
fore called vilesaya, include rodents, insectivorcs and reptiles. 

The anupa group has a mixed assortment of vertebrates and inverte- 
brates. The kulecara comprises herbivorous quadrupeds, like the elephant, 
rhinoceros, gavaya (mithun), buffalo and various kinds of deer, that fre- 
quent the banks of rivers and ponds. The plavas arc aquatic birds like 
ducks, geese and cranes. Of the remaining three groups, the inatsyas are 
fishes divided into two groups, marine and freshwater, timi and timingila and 
makara (whales and sharks?) finding place among marine fishes. Forms of 
body and peculiarities of locomotion of freshwater fishes from different 
types of habitats have been described with a certain degree of accuracy. 

The kosastha of the anupa comprises various kinds of molluscs living 
in shells. The pddJna includes a mixed assemblage of animals having pedal, 
or fin-like appendages, and to this group belong the oval- or oblong-shaped 
tortoises and turtles (kurma), crocodiles (kumbhira), white and black crabs 
(karkata) and the sisumdra, apparently the dolphin, with a muscular body, 
sharp protruding snout, breathing with a blow-hole out of water. 

In addition to the dietary classification, both Caraka and Susruta deal 
with groups of obnoxious and poisonous animals. Caraka’s krmi-varga 
dealing with worms or parasites contains four divisions depending on the 
location of the vermins, e.g. (a) those living in the body excretions— 

(lice), pipi/ikd (ants); (b) those living in the blood (blood-parasites)— 
bara, jantumdtd, kesada, lomada, lomadv'ipa, saurasa; (c) those living in 
the mucus and phlegm — anirada, curu, darbhapuspa, hrdayada, mahdguda, 
saugandhika, udaravesja; (d) those living in the faeces — kakeruka, leliha, 
makeruka, sasdlaka, sausuruda.^

Except for the first two, it is not possible to identify the others by 
names only. It should, however, be acknowledged that Caraka ascribed 
certain diseases of men to parasites living inside various parts of the body. 

The creatures with poisonous fangs listed by Caraka under Xhtgomayu- 
varga include the rats, snakes {asivisa), leeches, wall-lizards, spiders, scor- 
pions, frogs, fishes, mongooses, flying insects, centipedes, hornets, tigers, 
lions, dogs and hyenas. Nine kinds of snakes, of which a few are apparent- 
ly poisonous, are also listed. 

Susruta has listed 20 kinds of worms (krmi) or parasites of men, ori- 
ginating in faeces (purJsaja), cough or phlegm (kaphaja) or in blood (raktaja). 
Excepting for two or three, all the other names of parasites are different 
from those of Caraka. 

The noxious animals whose poisons are dangerous to man are listed 
by Susruta in some detail. The seat of poison of celestial serpents lies in 
their breath, of terrestrial ones in their fangs, and of cats, dogs, monkeys, 
makaras, frogs, paka-matsyas, monitor lizards (goclhd), molluscs (snails), 
pracalakas (a kind of insect), geckos and many insects in their teeth 
and claws. 

Among the noxious forms are listed 18 types of rats, 67 ‘families’ of 
insects and 30 kinds of scorpions. The scorpions are classified into manda- 
visa or mild-poisoned (12 kinds) germinating from cow-dung or any other 
rotten substances, madhyavisa or medium-poisoned (3 kinds) and strongly 
poisoned or tlksnavisa (15 types) which germinate from the putrefied 
dead body of a snake or any poisoned animal. Their characters and effects 
of venom are also described. Spiders are classed into fatal (non-curable) 
and non-fatal (curable) types depending on the nature of their poison. Of 
the 16 kinds of spiders listed, eight are fatally poisonous and the other 
eight are mildly poisonous. Centipedes are divided into eight kinds, and 
among insects, following centipedes, are listed eight different kinds of 
frogs that are said to be venomous. 

Snakes are treated by Susruta in great detail. Five different ‘families’ 
are noted, of which one is non-venomous and four (including a hybrid 
group) are venomous. The venomous group includes ddrvikara, the 
cobras of 26 varieties, hooded serpents, swift in their movements and with 
marks of chariot-wheels, ploughs, umbrellas, etc., on their hood. Mandali,^ 
another group of venomous serpents containing two species, are thick, 
slow-moving, nocturnal and bear circles or rings on their bodies. They 
do not have hoods. Rdjimat,^ the third group of venomous serpents, 
contains ten forms, non-hooded and nocturnal in their habits, bears series 
of dots or marks, often of variegated colours, on the upper parts and sides. 

“ The description of ma^dali (vipers) given by Susruta is fairly accurate. He lists two 
species of vipers, and this is in agreement with the current knowledge about Indian 
snakes. Only two species of vipers, Vipera riisselli and Echis carinatus, are known 
in India, and the description given by Susruta tallies fairly well with that of 
V. russelli—Xhc Russell's viper. 

* This corresponds fairly well with coral snakes. 



ZOOLOGY 


433 


Twelve non-venomous species and ten of hybrids (vaikaraHja) are 
listed. Ajagara, the Indian python {Python molurus), is mentioned as non- 
poisonous. 

Su^nita has also extensively dealt with the leeches (jalaukd) which 
were utilized in sucking out vitiated blood from the body. Jalaukd, crea- 
tures whose lives depend on water, are divided into 12 ‘species’, of which 
six are venomous and six non-venomous. Characters of different ‘species’ 
are described in some detail, which include the colouration, size, girth, 
distinctive spots, etc., on the body. The natural habitats of the leeches 
and their geographic distribution are also given. Venomous leeches are 
said to originate in the decomposed urine and faecal matter of toads and 
venomous fishes in pools of stagnant and turbid waters. The origin of 
non-venomous forms is ascribed to such decomposed matter as the putre- 
fied stems of several aquatic plants and the common zoophytes that live 
in clear water. 

The value of accurate identification of animals and plants was not 
unknown to the ancient Indians. The nomenclature adopted by them, 
generally derived from some characteristics of the organism or from their 
habits or habitats, is an adequate testimony to their efforts in this direction. 
Apparently, because of their constant familiarity with nature and life around 
them, they relied almost exclusively on names for identification of living 
objects and have left little descriptive accounts. For example, Varaha- 
mihira, according to B. K. Sarkar,® emphasized the importance of names 
in different countries; and hence the animals first be identified by their 
names ! He also attempted to classify animals according to their habits 
into nocturnal and diurnal kinds and into those that are seen during both 
day and night. 

References available in ancient texts indicate that the Indian philo- 
sophers and scholars of antiquity were also systematists and did try to 
identify animals and plants more or less along lines now characteristic of 
modern taxonomists. Seal* quotes from some (unnamed) handbooks 
the precise descriptions of deer and birds given by Dallana, the commentator 
of Susruta. He further cites the authority of pallana who has referred to 
the classification of kltas (insects and reptiles) by Ladyayaija, a noted spe- 
cialist on the group. Ladyayana gave criteria for distinguishing various 
types of kJtas by structural and behavioural peculiarities like ‘(1) dottings 
or markings, (2) wings, (3) pedal appendages, (4) mouth, with antennae or 
nippers {mukhasandamsa — Dallana), (5) claws, (6) sharp-pointed hair or 
filaments, (7) stings in the tail, (8) hymenopterous character {samlisfaih 
poksaromabhih), (9) humming or other noise, (10) size, (II) structure 
of the body, (12) sexual organs . . . and (13) poison and its action on 
bodies.’^

Last but not the least, we should like to refer to Ghosal’s elaborate 
treatment, in his own way, of classification of animals in ancient Hindu 
literature." 


ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY 

Ghosal states that the growth of knowledge of anatomy in ancient 
times took place chiefly from the necessity of treatment of human beings and 
domestic animals, and was based on the animals sacrificed in yajna. He 
further states that there are evidences of development of the knowledge 
of comparative anatomy in the ancient literature. The data compiled by 
him, though valuable as an indicator of the interest in animal and plant 
life, throw little light on the knowledge about anatomy that the ancient 
Indians actually possessed. He has, however, cited numerous ancient 
references (mostly in manuscript form) dealing with the veterinary sciences, 
specially those referring to elephants and horses, which were of importance 
to the kings and emperors in hunting and warfares. The treatises on 
veterinary medicine, the Gajayurveda and Asvayurveeb, have chapters on 
the anatomy and physiology of elephants and horses, but besides enumerat- 
ing various parts of animal bodies along the lines given in the samhitcls of 
Caraka and Susruta, there is nothing descriptive of note. 


EMBRYOLOGY 

As in anatomy and physiology, embryological knowledge of the ancient 
Indians was exclusively the product of observations made on human beings. 

The semen, according to Susruta, is the final product of metabolic 
activity of the body. Conception has been considered to be due to the 
union of sperm and ovum. The various signs of pregnancy, and prepara- 
tion necessary for a full-term pregnancy, along with the developmental 
stages of the foetus, beginning from the conception to the delivery, have 
been fairly accurately described in the Vedic and later Indian literature. 
The Garbhopanisad is one of the earliest works to record the development of 
human foetus. A more detailed account of the early development is given 
by Susruta. Keswani*^ has summarized the information contained in these 
two works. 


HEREDITY AND SEX-DETERMINATION 

The question of transmission of hereditary characters occupied the 
thoughts of the ancient Hindus since the Vedic times. In the Brdhmanas 
the question is first asked how specific characters are transmitted from the

parent to the offspring. The offspring belongs to the same species as the 
parent— how does it happen? And, the answer given is: species are like 
so many moulds into which the ovum is cast, even as molten metals are 
cast into the oven. 

Caraka and Susruta are of the opinion that in the fertilized ovum all 
organs are potentially present and they unfold in a certain order. Just as 
the bamboo-seed contains in miniature the entire structure of the bamboo, 
or the mango-blossom contains the stone, pulp and fibres which appear 
separated and distinct in the ripe fruit, so is the case with the fertilized ovum. 
Only the structures are so minute that they cannot be distinguished.® 

In Caraka and Susruta we meet with a theory, very much akin to the 
idea of pangencsis put forward by Darwin to explain the transmission of 
hereditary characters. Caraka assumes that the sperms of the male parent 
contain elements derived from each of its organs and its tissues, like ‘gem- 
mules' of Darwin or ‘ids' of Spencer. Sankara is of the same view, attri- 
buting to the sperm every organ of the parent organism in miniature, which 
holds in potentia the whole organism that is developed out of it. 

To explain, then, why congenital deformities of parents are not trans- 
mitted to the offspring, Caraka has an ingenious explanation, attributed to 
Atreya, which again resembles the theory propounded by Darwin. If the 
embryo derives its structure from every organ of the parents, why are 
congenital deformities like blindness, dumbness, lameness or any other 
similar defects not transmitted to the offspring? After all, the fertilized 
ovum is a miniature of all the organs and tissues of the parents. The 
difficulty is solved by the assumption that though composed of elements 
arising from the whole parental organism, the fertilized ovum is not in- 
fluenced by the developed organs of the parents with their congenital or 
acquired idiosyncrasies. The parental bJja (seed) contains the whole parental 
organism in miniature but is independent of its developed deformed organs. 
Only if the bJja of an clement representing a particular organ or tissue may 
happen to be defective or abnormal, the corresponding organ or tissue of 
the offspring will be similarly characterized; in other words, congenital 
deformities being somatic in character do not affect the germ plasm, and 
hence the normal and natural offspring. 

The determination of sex of the offspring was another important 
question that engaged the thought of ancient Hindus. 

The influence of nutrition on the characters of the blja, specially as 
regards sex, health, colour, etc., of the offspring is freely admitted and 
various recipes and rituals were prescribed and practised to produce the 
birth of a male child. 

It was generally believed that certain items of diet, ghee and milk for 
the male, and oil and beans for the female parents were favourable to the

hija (seed). The sexual characters of the offspring were believed to follow 
a law of alternate rhythmic change with respect to the menstrual cycle of 
the female parent before conception. According to this belief fertilization 
of the ovum on the fourth day after the menses, or on the alternate days 
succeeding, was favourable to the foetus developing male characters, and 
on the fifth, seventh and alternate following days to the foetus developing 
into a female. Another factor determining sex of the offspring is the 
relative preponderance of the ‘sperm and germ cells’ in the fertilized ovum. 
Susruta says, the birth of a male child marks the preponderance of semen 
over the ovum (in its conception); the birth of a daughter shows the pre- 
ponderance of the female element. A child of no-sex is a product when 
ovum and sperm are equal (in their quality and quantity).® Translated 
into modern idiom of hormones this will very much read like ‘preponderance 
of male hormones will tend to bring in maleness, that of the female hormones 
femaleness, the condition of sexlessness arising when the two hormones in 
the developing foetus are balanced’. Goldschmidt’s experiments on sex- 
uality on Lymantria dispar conducted during the first two decades of this 
century have produced results akin to what Caraka and Susruta deduced 
about 1,600 to 1,800 years back without any apparent experimental aids. 

In a recent publication, Verdi,^ without quoting any authorities, 
writes: ‘From time immemorial, there is a belief, in our land, about a 
link between determination of sex of human progeny and lunar phases. 
According to many, conceptions taking place during time periods between 
new moons and full moons — where the nights are called “luminous” — 
result in male children and conceptions taking place during time periods 
between full moons and new moons— where the nights are called “dark”— 
result in female children. 

‘However, some hold that contrary is true.’ 

COSMOGONY 

The question of the origin of the world and life therein, which assumed 
great importance in the later Vedic period (specially in the Vpanisads), 
had been raised even in the early samhitas. The tenth book of Rgveda 
has many hymns posing cosmogonical problems. These early speculations, 
though confused and larded with mythological and theological notions, 
are nevertheless interesting as the sources from which flew various streams 
of later thought. 

Older ideas in the Rgveda about the world centred round creation, 
gods or individual deities having generated the world. The conception of a 
distinct creator different from, and superior to, all gods, appearing under 
the various names of Purusa, Vmakarman, Hiranyagarbha or Prajapati, 
was a later development. ‘Whereas creation, according to the earlier view, 
is regularly referred to as an act of natural generation with some form of 


“ ss. :5s., 3 , 4 - 5 . 


^ Verdi, p. 12. 



ZOOLOGY 


437 


the verb jan “to beget”, these cosmogonic poems speak of it as the manu- 
facture or evolution from some original material.’® In the well-known 
Piirusa-sukta (the hymn of man), this material constituting the world is 
Purusa, the thousand-headed and thousand-footed primeval giant covering 
the earth and even extending beyond it.*' His head became the sky, his 
navel the air, his feet the earth; the moon, the sun and the wind springing 
respectively from his mind, eyes and breath. The germ of pantheism is 
inherent in the hymn, when it says that ‘Purusa is all this world, what has 
been and shall be’ and again ‘one-fourth of him is all creatures and three- 
fourths are the world of the immortals in heaven’. 

The Purusa assumes the role of the creator Prajapati in the Brahmanas, 
and in the Upanisads he is identified with the universe. Later, in the dual- 
istic Samkhya philosophy, Purusa is identified with the ‘soul’ as opposed to 
the matter. 

In other hymns dealing with the origin of the world, creation is not 
the collective effort of gods, but of an individual creator. This agent of 
generation was the sun, ‘the soul of all that moves and stands’.^ Here 
wc also see the first distinction between the mobile (jangania) animals and 
the fixed (st ha vara) plants. Two cosmogonic hymns arc addressed to the 
‘all-creating’ Visvakarman^ probably synonymous with the sun, ‘called by 
many names though one’.^ 

A much bolder step was the theory that the waters produced the first 
germ of things, the source of the universe and the gods.^ 

In another cosmogonic hymn of considerable beauty,-^ the primeval 
germ appears in the form of hir any agar bha, the germ of gold, a notion 
doubtless suggested by the rising sun. Here, too, the waters arc, in pro- 
ducing agni, regarded as bearing the germ of all life. 

Two other cosmogonic poems explain the origin of the world philo- 
sophically as the evolution of the existent (sat) from the non-existent (asat). 
In the somewhat confused account given in one of them,^ three stages of 
creation may be distinguished; first the world is produced, then the gods 
and lastly the sun. 

These ideas are presented more forcefully and beautifully in the Crea- 
tion Hymn 

Then was not non-existent nor existent: there was no realm of air, no sky 
beyond it. 

What covered it, and where? and what gave shelter? Was water there, 
infathomed depth of water ! 

Death was not then, nor was there aught immortal : no sign was there, the day’s 
and night’s divider. 

That One thing, breathless, breathed by its own nature : apart from it was nothing 
whatsoever.

Darkness there was: at first concealed in darkness this All was indisenminated 
chaos. 

All that existed then was void and formless: by the great power of warmth was 
born that unit. 

Thereafter rose Desire in the beginning. Divine, the primal seed and germ of spirit. 
Sages who searched with their heart’s thought discovered the existent’s kinship 
in the non-existent. 

Transversely was their severing line extended; what was above it then, and what 
below it? 

There were begetters, there were mighty forces, true action here and energy up 
yonder. 

Who verily knows and who can here declare it, whence it was born and whence 
comes this creation ? 

The gods are later than this world’s production. Who knows then whence it 
first came into being? 

He, the first origin of this creation, whether he formed it all or did not form it. 
Whose eye controls this world in highest heaven, he verily knows it, or perhaps he 
knows not.® 

Apart from its literary merit, this poem is most noteworthy for the 
daring speculations which find utterance in so remote an age. Being the 
only piece of sustained speculation in the Rgveda, it is the startingpoint 
of the natural philosophy which assumed shape in the evolutionary Samkhya 
system. It will, indeed, ever retain general interest as one of the earliest 
specimens of the Aryan philosophic thought. With the theory that, after 
the non-existent had developed into the existent, water came first and then 
intelligence was evolved from it by heat, the cosmogonic accounts of the 
Brahmanas substantially agree. Here, too, the non-existent becomes the 
existent, of which the first form is the water. On these floats hiranya- 
garbha, the cosmic golden egg, whence is produced the spirit that desires 
and creates the universe. Always requiring the agency of the creator 
Prajapati at an earlier or at a later stage, the Brahmanas in some of their 
accounts place him first, in others the water. The fundamental contradic- 
tion, due, perhaps, to mixing up the theory of creation with that of evolution, 
is removed in the Samkhya system by causing Pwri/.y^7, or soul, to play the part 
of a passive spectator, while Prakrti, or primordial matter, undergoes 
successive stages of evolutionary development. The cosmogonic hymns of 
the Rgvecia are thus not only the precursors of Indian philosophy but also 
of Purdnas, of which one of the main objects is to describe the origin of 
the world and life therein. 

ANIMALS AND NATURAL HISTORY IN THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD 

The trail blazed by ancient Indian naturalists tapers into the medieval 
period without much variations on the theme. The advent of the Muslims, 
particularly of the Moghuls from the sbeteenth century onwards, added a new 
perspective to the study of animals, inasmuch as they attemped to record

ZOOLOGY

observations made by themselves, or by others after careful verifications as 
far as possible. This transition is reflected in some of the important Sanskrit 
works of this period, followed by the memoirs of the Moghul kings. 
Of the Sanskrit works, the Mdnasollasa, composed by King Somesvara, 
deserves special mention. This interesting encyclopaedic work deals 
with recreation and describes in detail various modes of relaxation 
which include topics like drawing, painting, iconography, gardening, culi- 
nary art, cock-fighting, hunting, fishing, etc. Hora" has published an 
English translation of the fourteenth chapter of MdnasoUasa entitled Matsya- 
vinocla (the sport of angling). Somesvara gives a classification of sporting 
fishes as scaly and scaleless, lean and thin, and those living in sea or 
in rivers. He names 37 fishes, where they live and what they feed on. 
Furthermore, he deals with lines, hooks and baits suitable for various types 
of fishes, and advises on the sport of fishing. This w^ork, according to 
Hora, is rich in factual and deductive knowledge which in some respect 
remains unsurpassed even now. 

The only Indian work which may be said to deal exclusively with 
zoology is Hamsadeva’s Mr^a-paksi-sdstra, written in the thirteenth 
century a.d., at the behest of the Jaina King of Jinapura, Saudadeva, who, 
fascinated by the beauty of animals in forests, decided to stop hunting and 
to acquire knowledge about them. Haipsadeva’s account of beasts and 
birds can by no stretch of imagination be called scientific; rather his em- 
phasis is on the love-life of animals, their temperament (based strictly on the 
three faunas — sattva, rajas and tamas — of the philosophical system), their size, 
colour, etc. Nevertheless, the book represents the first attempt in India at 
large-scale description of animals of which the nomenclature as adopted by 
him is drawn almost exclusively from the Sanskrit literature of the middle and 
ancient ages. He describes six kinds of lions, three of tigers, two of 
hyenas (which he also calls leopards), three of bears, two of rhinos, thirteen 
of elephants, seven of horses, four of camels, three of asses, three of boars 
living in forests and seven living in country and villages (with which he 
confuses porcupines), five of buffaloes, etc. His list of birds is fairly long. 
In spite of the rather inaccurate treatment, one can discern accuracy of 
description of features helpful in identification. The many varieties listed 
are no doubt inspired by the synonyms, each of which has been erroneously 
treated as a separate kind. Furthermore, information about periods of gesta- 
tion, longevity, etc., is based more on hearsay than on factual observations. 

Sukraniti 

Anatomical details on the domestic animals, like the elephant, horse, 
cattle, etc., were mostly confined to the external morphological characters 
like the colour of body, colour of hair, proportions of body-parts, gait, 
temperament, etc. B. K. Sarkar has ably summarized the information on 
these aspects of elephants and horses available in ancient texts, specially 


Hora (3 ii), pp. 145-69. 



440 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


in the Sukrofuti. The assessment of the external characters of these animals 
was chiefly done from the practical point of view, to distinguish between 
the different qualities of animals in relation to their usefulness, and various 
breeds were enumerated taking into consideration the external characters 
of practical importance. 

The Muslim Period 

The Muslim rulers of India, in their own way, were sportsman-natural- 
ists. They were keen hunters and had big menagerie of horses, dogs, 
cheetahs, falcons, etc., which were primarily helpful in hunting. Few, 
however, have left records which could throw light on the fauna of the 
country or its natural history. The only exceptions are the Moghul kings 
whose memoirs and biographies bring to light interesting information 
about the fauna and flora of the period. Ali in a series of articles has 
given a lucid account of the love of nature of the six great Moghul kings, 
Babur to Aurangazeb. Apart from their keen interest in animals and 
nature, the Moghul rulers were particular about truthfulness and accuracy 
in their memoirs. 

Babur, after his victory at Panipat in a.d. 1526, proceeded to compile 
a comprehensive gazetteer of Hindustan, to describe at length the customs 
of peoples, animals, fruits and flowers of the land he had conquered. In 
recording his observations he had taken special care for their authenticity 
and accuracy. Even when engaged in affairs of the State, or marching 
against a foe, Babur was always awake to the objects around him, and 
anything new that he saw was carefully noted mentally and reduced to 
writing in his memoirs at the earliest opportunity. Of the larger mammals, 
he was very fond of hunting the rhinoceros, an animal he had not seen 
in his native land. He frequently hunted the rhinos in the jungles of 
Peshawar and Hashnagar. 

Humayun( 1530- 1540, 1555-1556), in his chequered career, had but little 
time to indulge in hunting animals. Yet his deep love of animals and 
nature is reflected in little passages of Tazkerech. 

Akbar (1556-1605) was passionately enamoured of animals of all 
kinds from Persia, Turkestan and Kashmir. The inmates of his menagerie, 
which were every day led past under the royal window for the monarch’s 
observation, included horses, elephants, antelopes, nilgais, rhinoceroses, 
large buffaloes with prodigious horns, lions, tigers, some of the finest sport- 
ing dogs of every kind from Uzbek, and species of birds of prey used in 
field sports for catching partridges, cranes, hares, and even for hunting 
antelopes on which they pounced with violence. 

Moreover, he was a great breeder of domestic animals— elephants, 
camels, cows and horses — ^and the breeds of horses produced in his stables 
were as fine as those of Arabia. 

His mode of hunting most frequently employed was quamargah or 
‘ringing in’ method. He employed his armies (which kept them trim in

times of peace) to surround vast tracks of the countryside, gradually 
closing in, and driving the game towards the centre of the ring where the 
royal hunters lay in wait. 

The Game Department of Akbar maintained a record of all animals 
hunted, with measurements and the minutest details concerning them. He 
possessed a remarkably large number of cheetahs or hunting leopards 
(about 9,000), a species now extinct from India, and ‘lynxes’ 
(? caracal), in addition to a large variety of good hunting dogs. His birds 
of prey, trained in sport, were the haz (Accipiter gentilis), shdhin (Falco 
peregrinus) and shunqor (Falco biarmicus) and burquat falcon (probably the 
golden eagle, Aquila chrysaetos). The Emperor, however, preferred the bashdh 
(sparrow-hawk, Accipiter nisus), which was given various names by him. 

Jahangir (1605-1627) was the greatest naturalist among the Moghuls, 
just as his father was the greatest Emperor. ‘His profuse and engrossing 
memoirs are a veritable natural history of the animals that came under 
his notice, and a record of the most searching observations concerning 
them.’® For exhaustive account of Jahangir as a naturalist, Alvi and 
Rahman’s book may also be referred to (Alvi and Rahman (2)). In this 
monograph the authors have ably brought together all available informa- 
tion about this particular fact of Jahangir who could have been a better and 
happier man as the head of a natural history museum. 

His love for animals was so widely known that foreign dignitaries often 
gave him presents of exotic animals, and his court artists, specially IJstad 
Mansur, were kept busily engaged in drawing the likeness of animals and 
other objects that came to the Emperor or to his notice. Mansur excelled 
in the art of animal and floral portraiture, as accurate and meticulous as 
their literary records maintained by the Emperor. Many of the animal 
paintings made by the court artists of Jahangir have been lost, but whatever 
has survived (scattered in several museums and private collections) can be 
of great utility to modern taxonomists and naturalists for their accuracy 
of representation (Pis. VII, VIII, IX). 

Though not a trained zoologist, Jahangir’s keen powers of observation 
and passion for knowledge imparted to his descriptions an objective 
thoroughness characteristic of modern scientific writing. In describing 
organisms observed by him, he gave local names, geographical distribution 
and even structural characteristics, weights, measurements and some 
interesting notes on ecology and behaviour. Though characterized by an 
overtone of the admiration for beauty or a feeling of repulsion for an ugly 
animal, his descriptions were often precise enough for the correct scientific 
identification of the objects described. His studies of the sarus crane, 
and the gestation period of the elephant, are two amongst his original 
contributions, and his observations on the ecology, behaviour, etc., of 
animals generally might come under the same category as ‘the first records’ 
of modern zoological writers. 


Ali, p. 841.

Jahangir maiiilained a big aviary and menagerie where he carried on 
his observations, tests and experiments. His curiosity and passion for 
verifying hearsay often led him to dissect objects of his hunt and to examine 
the internals. He was specially interested in the position of the gall- 
bladder and never failed to verify whether this organ was situated inside 
the liver or outside. It may be of interest to note that what was just a 
natural curiosity for Jahangir assumed great importance some 300 years 
later. From the functional and evolutionary points of view, the presence 
or absence, size and position of gall-bladders in various animals formed 
topics of extensive investigations during the third and fourth decades of 
the present century. He was also keen to study the reproductive behaviour 
of animals in captivity and recorded some interesting observations on the 
breeding of the cheetah and of the tiger in captivity. Equally interesting 
are his observations on the diet of the Indian python (Python molurus) 
‘which can swallow up to a hog-deer’ and of the king-cobra (Ophiophagus 
hannah) which was seen swallowing another cobra. 

Jahangir’s repute as a hunter was no less than his passion for nature, 
and his records reveal astronomical figures, 3,203 mammals and 13,954 
birds. The nilgai (889), and deer, antelopes, mountain goat, etc. (1,670), 
among mammals, and pigeons (10,348) and crows (3,276) appeared to be 
his special targets. 

The two last eminent Mughal kings, Shah Jahan and Aurangzcb, did 
inlierit the qualities of their ancestors, but not to the same extent as 
Jahangir’s or Akbar’s. 

The animals mentioned in the memoirs of the Moghul kings have been 
listed by Ali, along with notes recorded by them. Jahangir’s animals have 
also been dealt with by Alvi and Rahman. Of special interest in this connec- 
tion is the find of a miniature portrait of the dodo (a bird from Madagascar 
now extinct) in the collection of the Institute of Orientalists of the USSR, 
Academy of Sciences. This remarkable miniature (PL IX), apparently drawn 
from a live specimen, though unsigned and undated, bears the unmistakable 
Mansur style and was probably drawn from a collection of three birds in 
the possession of the East India Company’s Factory at Surat where it was 
observed and described by Mundy in 1628. 

ANIMALS IN SANGAM LITERATURE OF THE TAMIL COUNTRY 

The Tamil country of the south is also rich in literature on animals 
and their natural history. Rao® has dealt with the animals mentioned in 
the ancient Tamil Sahgam literature. This literature was certainly spread 
over a long period, which according to estimates lasted from 3000 b.c. to 
A.D. 1915. Nilakantha Sastri (vide Rao), however, is of the view that 
this literature was spread over four centuries commencing with the fourth 
century a.d.

in a natural history. Most of the animals mentioned in this literature also 
occur in the Vedic and post-Vedic literature of north India.

THE PHYSICAL WORLD- 
VIEWS AND CONCEPTS 

B. V. SUBBARAYAPPA 


INTRODUCTION 

In the perspective of history, the ancient inquiries concerning the nature 
of the physical world seem to have two characteristics, viz. (i) they had 
almost similar types of origins and patterns of development in more than 
one culture-area; and (ii) not a few of the ancient metaphysical concepts, 
Ihougli intuitive, appear to be near approximations to some of the modern 
physical ideas arrived at by methods of induction, deduction and experimen- 
tation. In different periods of history man, the thinker, very often turned 
his attention to that elusive problem— the problem of One in Many— in 
other words, to the plausible explanation of the maximum of phenomena by 
the minimum of postulates. That in this way the physical world is capable 
of human understanding has been the tacit premise of the ancient thinkers 
and men of modern science alike. In ancient times, nevertheless, the attempt 
was at a rational and knowable interpretation of the physical world and 
seldom at manipulating it towards the material benefits of man . This attitude 
manifested itself in different speculations or conceptual schemes and, in 
the evolution of the latter, logic and deduction played a dominant role. 
Even so, the world-view, as it may be called, of the ancient thinkers was 
not the one which was exclusive of man himself. The knower and the 
known, man and the world, the individual spirit and the cosmic spirit were 
integrated in some form or the other. 

In its earlier phase this man-spirit-cosmos view, indeed a wider and 
richer view of the world which was prevalent in different culture-areas, 
was often mixed up with mythological elements. Gradually it became 
freed from its mythological shackles and acquired a rational or intellectual 
foundation. It was a struggle of logos against mythos, the former steadily 
gaining ground over the latter. In so emerging the world-view assumed 
another phase. It became intertwined with the philosophical system or 
systems of the culture-area. In addition, now and then in the Middle 
Ages, theological implications too made inroads into the otherwise rational 
world-view. In the history of science the views and concepts of the physical

world coining to the fore, both intuitively and on logical grounds, should 
be understood in this light. To illustrate what has been stated above the 
two good examples are the speculative inquiries of the Indians and of 
the Greeks. 

Let us consider the Greeks first.®' ^ The early Greek thinkers attempted 
for the first time to give a rational interpretation of the natural occurrences. 
Some of them tackled the problem of one in many, of finding the single 
‘principle’, ‘substance’ or ‘essence’, which could explain all the ob- 
served phenomena. Thales of Miletus (c. 624-565 B.c.) thought that 
water was the ‘substance’ or primal matter which would remain un- 
changed amidst all observed modifications. Obviously he had observed 
how water would change, flow without any shape or colour and undergo 
a cycle of movement on earth and in air. He conjectured that there was 
a substance (water) ‘from which all other things came to be, it being con- 
served’. That water was the primordial substance was known to the 
Babylonians. But they had imagined it in a mythological setting. But 
Thales of Miletus discarded the mythological element and tried to interpret 
the natural happenings in the universe of matter in terms of a single sub- 
stance. In consequence he became the stimulator of a system of Greek 
philosophy and of attempts at formulating unitary conceptions. 

Following on, another Milesian philosopher, Anaximander (c. 611- 
575 B.C.), speculated on the essential unity of matter and assumed, as the 
first principle, an unlimited substance (Infinite), a qualitatively undeter- 
mined eternal matter in motion (apeiron). Yet another Milesian philo- 
sopher, Anaximenes, specified the concept of Anaximander by saying that 
the first principle was ‘air’ (pneunia) with dynamic qualities (perpetual 
motion). Later Anaximenes, a contemporary of Anaximander, thought 
that the process of condensation or rarefaction caused transformations of 
the primary substance into various others. Heracleitus of Ephesus (c. 540- 
475 B.c.) regarded ‘fire’ as the fundamental principle in an ingenious 
way. He thought that the world was one and at the same time many. 
He held that the whole world was in a flux of change, and change alone 
was real, ‘Fire’ was representative of this change and so it was the funda- 
mental principle. As against this Parmenides of Elea in South Italy re- 
garded change as illusion and introduced the concept of One. 

From these unitary conceptions, each of which had its inherent defi- 
ciencies to account for all the observed phenomena, a pluralistic presenta- 
tion was put forward by the Sicilian philosopher Empedocles (c. 500- 
430 B.C.). Adding ‘earth’ as the fourth principle, Empedocles sought 
to explain the multiplicity of phenomena in terms of earth, water, air and 
fire. He called them the ‘roots of the world’. He also introduced the 
idea of force eternally acting on these ‘roots’ in a speculative way, in 
terms of love and strife and held that they were responsible for all combina- 
tions and separations respectively. He went a step further and main-

THE PHYSICAL WORLD: VIEWS AND CONCEPTS

tained that these ‘roots’ were causes of all occurrences even in macro- 
cosm. Anaxagoras, a contemporary of Empedocles, assumed a number 
of infinitely small ‘seeds’ (Aristotle called them homeomeres) of infinite 
variety in infinite space, subject to the action of mind or breath (nous) 
which directed production, evolution and dissolution of the world. This 
type of speculation reached another stage when Leucippus (fl. c. 475 B.c.) 
and Democritus (c. 470-400 b.c.) postulated an atomic view of the sub- 
stance and said that atoms were of the same substance, but of different 
sizes and shapes. The Greek atomism, needless to add, was one of intuition. 

The author of the ‘Principle of Uncertainty’ in modern physics, 
Werner Heisenberg, in his observation on the foregoing Greek concep- 
tions, remarks that ‘some statements of ancient philosophy arc rather 
near to those of modern science. This simply shows how far one can 
get by combining the ordinary experience of nature that we have, without 
doing experiments with the untiring effort to get some logical order into 
this experience to understand from general principles’. According to 
Heisenberg, the ‘Fire’ of Heracleitus corresponds to the modern concept 
of energy, ‘for energy is a substance which moves and from which all 
things are made’. Further, he holds that as the atoms of Democritus 
are devoid of qualities, have extension in space, and motion, the ‘neutron’ 
of modern physics resembles the former. But he warns that ‘this com- 
parison should not be misunderstood. It may seem at first sight that 
the Greek philosophers have by some kind of ingenious intuition came 
to the same or very similar conclusions as we have in modern times only 
after several centuries of hard labour with experiments and mathematics . . . 
There is an enormous difference between modern sciences and Greek 
Philosophy, and that is just the cmpiristic attitude of modern science ’.“ 

In India, the first monistic principle expressed in the Rgvccla Samhitd, 
the oldest literary record of the Vedic Age, is ‘water’. Later in the 
Upanisads, in a progressive way, the doctrine of five elements took shape. 
As this aspect of the Indian world-view is discussed in the following pages, 
details of the gradual unfolding of this doctrine arc not presented here. 
There arc, however, noticeable differences between the Empcdoclean theory 
of four elements and the Indian doctrine of the five elements. What is 
important, nevertheless, is the notable commonness of attempt at reducing 
the knowable phenomena into the interplay of four or five elements respec- 
tively. In both, the fundamental principles like earth, water, etc., had 
not only their philosophical implications but also assumed a plural 
presentation. Like the Greeks, Indians also developed an atomic theory. 
The Indian atomic theory, from its simple beginnings, became a favourite 
frame of protracted discussion, as will be seen later, among the Indian 
speculative philosophers. Logic and causal considerations occupied a 
pride of place in these discussions. Similarly, Leucippus, the originator 
of the Greek atomic theory, is believed to have stated that ‘Nothing occurs

by chance, for there is a reason, a necessity for everything*. Unwavering 
dependence on reason, on the relation between cause and effect shaped the 
speculative inquiries of both the Greek and the Indian thinkers. 

Such as they are, the speculative enquiries lay stress on one historically 
important factor, namely both India and Greece developed the most 
consistent and logical theories discernibly on parallel lines. Richard 
Garbe writes: ‘The historical possibility of the Grecian world of thought 
being influenced by India through the medium of Persia must unquestion- 
ably be granted, and with it the possibility of the above-mentioned ideas 
being transferred from India to Greece.’^ However, other scholars 
like Max Muller and Paul Deussen suggest that the developments are 
independent. Even so the remarkable resemblances in the Indian and 
Greek theories of matter cannot be brushed aside. 

In one respect the Indian speculative inquiry seems to have gone a 
step ahead. It relates to what is known as the conception of ‘substance’. 
In the ancient period, the conception of ‘substance’ was a part of the 
general inquiry into the intelligible reality. The two Greek thinkers, Plato 
(427-347 B.c.) and Aristotle (384-322 b.c.), inquired into this aspect, and 
each put forward a different conception of substance. Plato conceived 
of it as the Universal Idea which, he thought, existed apart from the things 
of the world. Aristotle imagined it as potentiality with no independent 
existence. He enunciated that matter was potential and form was actual. 
He thought that the Empedoclean ‘elements’ were different aspects of 
primary matter (protyle) in which all the knowable forms of matter were 
potentially contained.** The Aristotelian conception of substance, with 
some modifications, formed the basis for interpreting the phenomena 
even till the beginnings of modern science (about seventeenth century 
A.D.). The point worthy of noting is that both in medieval Europe which 
inherited Aristotelian philosophy and in India which developed on its 
own a number of systems of inquiry, the conception of substance received 
considerable attention. 

Of special interest is the conception of substance of the Vaisesika, 
one of the six orthodox systems of Indian thought. The Vaisesika concep- 
tion was elaborated later by the exponents of not only the Vaisesika school 
but also by the followers of the Nyaya, another Indian orthodox system of 
thought. The Nyaya-Vaisesika conception of substance seems to be 
unique. It includes the five elements (earth, water, fire, air and akasa), 
space and time, self and mind — nine in all. It is pluralistic presentation 
consisting of the material and the non-material, the finite and the ubi- 
quitous, and the conscious self as well as mind in an ingenious way. The 
Nyaya-Vaik^ika system accepts the multiple character of reality and holds 
substance as one of the reals. Each of the nine, as mentioned above, 
is called substance again and thus there are nine substances. All the same, 
they are integrated with the generic conception of substance.

THE PHYSICAL WORLD: VIEWS AND CONCEPTS 


449 


The inclusion of space, time, self and mind in this generic conception 
of substance has a far greater import from the standpoint of the modern 
scientific epistemology. The latter which tries to throw light on the nature 
and structure of modern scientific knowledge, particularly about the physical 
world, is still unable to steer clear of the conceptual inadequacies con- 
cerning substance. What is substance? This question with its contest- 
able character has remained still unsolved by modern scientific epistemo- 
logists. This is evidenced by the vicissitudes through which the problem 
of matter has passed as a result of scientific investigations in the last century 
and half, viz. the law of conservation of mass, the law of conservation of 
energy, the fundamental particles, wave nature of electron, energy-matter 
relationship and the like. 

The scientific approach takes cognizance of the ‘observables* and 
the associated causal mechanism; the unobservables are outside its prov- 
ince. The observational procedure deliberately excludes the observer; 
for the latter, the subjective element, is believed to run counter to the 
objective investigation based on the scientific methods of experimentation, 
induction and deduction. The exclusion of the subjective element (i.e. 
a complex mechanism involving the notion of ‘1*, mind, senses, nerve 
impulses and other determinants of observation) which is an integral part 
of the observational procedure seems to have come in the way of arriving 
at the conception of substance by the modern scientific epistemologisls. The 
fact is that the observer participates in the methods of observation and 
necessarily the self and mind of the observer would also constitute the 
determinants of observation. If the observational procedure were to lead 
to the comprehension of substance or the world-stuff, it has of necessity 
to be inclusive of these determinants. In this respect the Nyaya-Vaisesika 
conception of substance with its causal garment merits serious attention. 
The foregoing discussion, though brief, may be kept in mind while under- 
standing the different speculative inquiries of the Indian thinkers, who 
have tried in their own way to present a view of the physical world, in the 
history of scientific ideas. 

It must be noted that the Indian physical concepts, in their origin 
and ramification, have been an integral part of the Indian religio-philo- 
sophical systems, both orthodox and heterodox. For, within the confines of 
the respective philosophical positions alone the physical concepts attempt 
to explain the material world. The Indian thinkers believed that the special 
knowledge as contained in the different sciences was always relatively real 
and gave only the glimpse of the Absolute. Real knowledge, they thought, 
was necessary to realize the Absolute. Obviously towards this end they 
speculated on what may be called the interrelatedness of things and the 
thought processes associated with them. 

MAIN LITERARY SOURCES 

Even though the physical concepts of the Indian thinkers are in point 
of fact bold and imaginative, strangely there are no Indian texts which 


29 



450 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


exclusively deal with them. Each system of Indian thought has built up 
its own physical and metaphysical views. One has to go through a volu- 
minous literature to locate the origin and trace the evolution of the Indian 
physical concepts. The Vedic literature (the four Samhitds, Brdhmanas, 
Aranyakas, Upanisads and the Vedangas); the Purdnas, epics and itihdsas: 
the literature of the Nydya-Vaiksika, Sdmkhya, Yoga and the Mimdmsds; 
the Buddhist and the Jaina texts; the tantrik literature; works on Ayurveda 
and astronomy are among the important literary sources which contain the 
fundamental as well as evolved physical ideas of Indians over a long period — 
perhaps stretching to about two thousand years. The literature is as 
varied as it is vast; for even in the works of a particular school of thinking 
the conceptual scheme relating to certain physical concepts like atomism, 
space and time, presents a wide spectrum of ideas. Nevertheless, it would 
be wrong to conclude that the speculations are an ensemble of dogmatic, 
complex assertions. On the other hand, they are refreshingly noted 
for their logical structure cast in a well conceived and rigorously balanced 
causal sequence. In essence, then, they are logical postulates. 

Among the main literary sources those which expound one of the 
systems of Indian thought, viz. the Vaisesika, are very important from the 
point of view of the physical concepts. The Vaisesika sutra of Kanada 
and the Paddrthadharmasarpgraha of Prasastapada are the two principal 
authorities of the Vaiksika school. Though a gloss on the Vaiksika sutra, 
the Paddrthadharmasamgraha has the characteristics of an original work. 
The Vaiksika school is supposed to have been propounded by a sage 
called Kanada. Kanada, Kanabhuj or Kanabhaksa, as he is differently 
referred to, means one who eats particle or grain, indicating probably the 
atomic particles; and this is attributed to the fact that Kanada enunciated 
the essentials of an atomic theory.® The Vaiksika, even in its sutra form, 
is very old, possibly pre-Buddhistic.^ However, the origins of the Vaiksika 
sutras are obscure. There are reasons to believe that the Vaiksika school 
in its beginning was heterodox in position not taking shelter under the 
umbrella of orthodox Vedic views. Later it appears to have absorbed 
the Vedic concept of dharma and thus entered the orthodox fold.*^ Never- 
theless, it is rather important to note that the Vaiksika recognizes both 
perception and inference as means of acquiring knowledge and does not 
accord a pride of place to the authority of the Vedic tenets. 

In its ten chapters the Vaiksika sutra of Kanada deals with a number 
of physical concepts, the most important of which are those concerning 
substance, motion, attributes, space, time and atomism. These were 
developed later by a number of followers of the Vaiksika and the Nydya 
schools. By about the tenth century a.d. the two schools began to be 
recognized by a syncretic nomenclature, the Nydya-Vaik^ika. The Vaiksika 
and the Nydya schools developed a theory of causation known as drambha- 
vada. The two significant aspects of the drambhavdda are : (i) that the cause

and the effect are different and (ii) that there is a continuity {sanvayata) 
between the two. In this process of thinking the relation between the 
whole and its parts is rather interesting. The whole, when it comes into 
existence, is non-existent as separate parts; for as an effect it has a new 
beginning. Yet when the whole is destroyed the parts exist, and the parts 
have altogether a different significance. The important physical concepts 
of the Nydya-Vaise^ika in general and the atomism in particular are based 
upon this theory of causation.® 

Apart from the Vaisesika suira and the Padarthadharmasamgraha of 
Pra^astapada, the other Nydya-Vaisesika texts which contain significant ac- 
counts of the Indian physical concepts and deserve special mention are: 
Nydya-sutra by Gautama (c. fourth century B.c.); Nydyabhdsya by 
Vatsyayana (c. fourth century A.D.); Nydya-varttika by Udyotakara (seventh 
century A.D.); Nydyasdra by Bhasarvajna (eighth century A.D.); Nyaya- 
vdrttika tatparyaflkd by Vacaspati Misra (ninth century A.D.); Nydyamanjari 
by Jayanta BhaUa (ninth century A.D.); Vyomavati by Vyoma^ivacarya 
(c. ninth century a.d.); KiramvaU by Udayana (tenth century A.D.); Nydya- 
kandall by Sridhara (tenth century A.D.); Saptapaddrthi by Sivaditya 
(eleventh century \ Nydyalildvatiby Vallabhacarya (twelfth century a.d.); 
NydyasiddhdntadJpa by ^a^adhara (twelfth century a.d.); Tattvacintdmani by 
Gangesa Upadhyaya (thirteenth century a.d.); Upaskdra and Kandda- 
rahasya by Sankara Mika (fifteenth century a.d.) ; Paddrthatattva nirupam 
by Raghunatha Siromani (sixteenth century a.d.); and Bhdsdpariccheda and 
Nydya-muktdvali by Vikanatha (seventeenth century a.d.).^ 

Of the Jaina texts, Umasvatl’s Tattvdrthddhigamasutra (second century 
a.d.); Bhagvatl Sutra {c. fourth to fifth centuries a.d.); Siddhasena Divakara’s 
Nydydvatdra (sixth century a.d.); Nemicandra’s Dravyasaipgraha (twelfth 
century a.d.); Mallisena’s Syddvddamanjari (thirteenth century a.d.) are im- 
portant. Among the noted Buddhist works are Samyutta Nikdya, Dhamma- 
sahgani, Buddhaghosa’s Atthasdlim and Visudhimagga (c. fifth century 
A.D.); Vasubandhu’s Abhidhammakosa (fourth to sixth centuries a.d.); Abhi- 
dhammamatthasamgraha; Dinnaga’s Pramdnasamuccaya and Nydyapravesa 
(sixth century a.d.) and Dharmakirtti’s Nydyabindu (seventh century 
A.D.). 

In this short account an attempt is made only to present a bird’s-eye 
view of the important physical concepts of the Indian thinkers as contained 
in the literary sources. Perhaps it would have been appropriate if a period- 
wise presentation of these concepts and conceptual schemes was attempted 
bringing to the fore at the same time their originators. In the present 
state of knowledge it is feared that such an attempt may result in historically 
tantalizing inaccuracies. In view of this, what follows is a broad historical 
outline of the significant views and concepts of the Indians concerning the 
physical world. Later, they are discussed under such heads as are relevant 
to our purpose.

UNIVERSAL CONCEPTIONS 

COSMIC LIGHT, RTAM aND YAJna 

To Start with, it is rather necessary to make a brief reference to certain 
universal conceptions which are found in the Vedic literature. A striking 
feature of the Rgveda is its attempt to discover the essence or the power 
that is behind all manifestations.® In this respect the conception of 
cosmic energy or cosmic light as dealt with in the Rgveda deserves special 
mention. The unmanifested is cosmic energy, and the manifested is cosmic 
light. The latter is referred to as Vihajyoti, which is a positive unitary 
principle, pure and sublime. In fact, the Vedic gods and their functional 
attributes are to be understood in terms of cosmic light. The Rgveda 
says that gods worship the cosmic light as the principle of life and lon- 
gevity, and that the cosmic light is the ‘soul of all gods’ and the ‘womb’ 
of all created things.*’ Aditi, which means the boundless or the unbounded 
and which according to the Rgveda is the substratum (pure consciousness 
of infinite existence) of all that is here and beyond, is the Light-Infinite.^ 
Gods who are bom of Aditi are manifestations of the Infinite Light. Later 
in the Upani^ads, Brahman is referred to as the Self-Luminous Light.^ 
‘He is the light of lights and the whole world is illuminated with His light.’ 
‘Thousands of Suns pale into nothingness before this Divine Light.*

In consonance with the conception of cosmic light is that of cosmic 
law, which is known as rta. The all-pervading light, Aditya or Surya, 
is extolled as the dweller in eternal (Law) and, eventually, the eternal law 
itself.® Surya sheds his light according to fta and he is the face of 
Rta means ‘the course of things’, order or law which is the primal principle, 
non-temporal and cohesive. It is a natural law which even the Vedic 
gods had to follow. Gods are often described in terms of ‘guardians 
of rta' and ‘practisers of rta'.^ Figuratively it is stated that ‘Gods chant 
the song of fta.^ The natural phenomena, such as the flow of 
rivers, change of seasons, day and night, are stated to be in accordance 
with this natural law.® Symbolically rta was also conceived by the Rgvedic 
seers as Varum who was supposed to have determined the laws of the 
physical universe. The Rgveda says that it is because of rta^ Indra ‘lights 
up and energizes the whole world’, and that ‘the appearance of usas and 
its illumination of the universe are in conformity with rta'J In addi- 
tion, all the phenomena which occur in cycles are stated to be controlled 
by rta. In short, rta is a unitary active principle present everywhere and 
in everything. As eternal order, it is transcendental signifying uniformity 
of nature or an ordered course in a cosmic sense. The Rgvedic seers 
were convinced that nature is not heterogeneous as it seems to us, and that 
all types of natural motions are traceable to rta which, according to them, 
is self-existent and ever extending. 

Whitehead rightly observes: ‘In the first place there can be no 
living science unless there is a widespread instinctive conviction in the 
existence of an order of things and in particular of an order of nature.’*^ 
The Vedic people had the instinctive conviction in the natural order. They 
thought of the external world as an ordered whole and that its dynamic or 
changing phenomena were regulated by rta. In the Rgveda, therefore, 
everything is extolled as beautiful and brilliant, for there is no place for 
chaos and ugliness in the orderly universe. Probably in no other contem- 
porary literature of the Rgvedic time was there such a conception of natural 
law. 

Intimately connected with rta is another monistic principle of the 
J^veda, viz. yajHa or the act of sacrifice. Yajria is referred to as the navel 
of the universe (yiivanabhi) round which the latter turns, and as the uni- 
fying principle which expands and contracts in accordance with the happen- 
ings in the universe. For, the Rgvedic seers believed that yajHa is the 
instrument for preserving the cycle of cosmic events in harmony. YajHa 
is praised as '‘r^CLsya dhSma and rtasya sadana' (the abode of rtd).^ The 
act of yajHa is for the protection of rta. YajHa has the connotation of 
dynamism, too, for it is ‘that which expands with the world, and dissolves

with the world into the creator*. It is thus conceived as a connective 
dynamic principle in the manifested world, a nucleus (nMi) of all evolu- 
tion and thus the protector and nourisher of the universe. 

Perhaps the highest monistic level was reached by the Vedic thinkers 
when they thought of a unitary world-ground encompassing the being and 
the non-being, the living and the non-living. The famous hymn of creation, 
called the Ndsadlya Sukta in the tenth Mandala of the Rg\eda,^ speaks 
of water as the supra-sensible First Cause or the primeval world-ground; 
and water is the first ‘element* to be conceived in this manner, without 
any mythological association. ‘ Then there was neither Aught nor Nought, 
nor air nor sky beyond; what covered all? Where tested all? In watery 
gulf profound ? ... The one breathed calmly, self-contained ; nought else 
beyond it lay. Gloom hid in gloom existed first — One sea, eluding view.’ 

The foregoing are among the important universal speculations con- 
cerning energy (yismjyoti), motion {rtam and yajhd) and the primordial stuff 
of the world (water), appearing in perhaps the most ancient literature of 
its type in the world. The fact of great significance is that these concep- 
tions were the result of a desire to know the world as a whole — a desire 
so characteristic of the thinkers of the Vedic period as stated in the fol- 
lowing Rgvedic mantra: ‘Give sight to our eyes, sight to our bodies so that 
they can see. May we see the world as a whole, may we see it in detail.’^ 


THE DOCTRINE OF FIVE ELEMENTS 

The universal conceptions, as mentioned above, laid the foundations 
for newer formulations, again wholistic in nature and structure. One 
such formulation was the doctrine of five elements to account for the 
apparently unordered, diverse world of matter and qualities. Known as 
Pancabhutas {mahdbhutdni), the five elements are: prthvi, ap, tejas, ydyu 
and dkdsa. These may, for purposes of understanding, be designated 
respectively as earth, water, fire, air and a non-material uniquitous sub- 
stance. But it must be noted that the five elements have a wider connota- 
tion and significance than the familiar earth, water, fire or air. Moreover 
the corresponding words in English cannot be deemed as being the proper 
equivalents. It is, therefore, essential to bear in mind the Sanskrit terms 
wherever the seemingly corresponding words in English are used to 
denote them. Further, each element has to be understood in relation to 
the other four. In other words, the doctrine of five elements should be 
viewed in its totality. 

The fivefold character of the doctrine gradually assumed shape out 
of simpler conceptions. As stated before, primeval water is the first ele- 
ment in the Indian speculation. Later in the Brhaddranyaka Upani^ad,^ 
it is stated: ‘In the beginning this world was just water.’ The Chdndogya,^

gives an account of the World-stuff as follows: ‘It is just water solidified, 
that is the earth,— the atmosphere,— the sky,— the gods— and men,— 
beasts and birds,— grass and trees, — animals together with worms, — flies 
and ants; all these are just water solidified.’ In Kausitakf,^ it is explicitly 
stated that ‘the waters, verily indeed are my (Brahma’s) world’. A 
clear and evolutionary development of the three elements in this order: 
water, fire, and dkasa, occurs again in the Chandogya Upanisad, in a 
series of assertions relating to a progressive understanding of Brahman 
as the Universal Soul which is the main current of the Upanisadic thought. 
The Chandogya also states that ‘Brahman, desiring to be many, created 
tejas (fire), ap (water) and ksiti (earth), and entered into these three’. 

Besides, there are a number of passages in the Upanisadic literature 
dealing with the elements step by step towards a unitary conception. The 
Taittirlya states: ‘From this Soul {dtman), verily, {dkd§a) arose; from 
dkd^a, wind (ydyu)\ from wind, fire (agni)\ from fire, water {ap)\ from water, 
the earth; from the earth, herbs; from herbs, food; from food, semen; 
from semen, the person {purusaY^ while the AHareya thinks of the five ele- 
ments in relation to Brahman, the concept of five elements occurs in the 
Taittirlya, Aitareya and Maitrl Upanisads. In the MaitrJ it is explicitly stated 
that ‘the three-quartered Brahman has its root above, its branches are 
dkdsa, vdyu, tejas, ap and pfthvV,^ 

The Indian doctrine of five elements, it must be emphasized, is a part 
of the philosophical ideas. In other words, it does not have an inde- 
pendent standing apart from its being an integrated component of the 
leading systems of Indian thought. Among the six orthodox systems 
(so-called because of their acceptance of the Vedic texts) the Sdmkhya, 
Nydya and the Vaisesika have laid special emphasis on the five elements. 
The Jaina, Bauddha and the Carvaka schools recognize only the first four 
elements. 

Sdmkhya 

The classical Sdmkhya has the following enumeration : 

prakfti—purusa 

mahdn (consciousness) 


ahahkdra (ego) 
manas (mind) 
ten indriyas 


five tanmdtras 


five bhutas (elements).

In this enumeration of totality the five tanmatras and the corresponding 
five elements are of special significance. The tanmatra is considered to be 
invisible and eternal while the corresponding elements, the produced ones, 
are not eternal. It is rather difficult to define exactly the tanmatras. Per- 
haps they share the characteristics of both mind and matter, and they seem 
to represent the very core of the element in the finest state, possibly with 
the inherent power of affecting the respective senses. 

The origin of the concept of tanmatra can be found in some of the 
later Upani^ads. In the Praha Upanisad,^ the subtle states are called 
prthvl-mdtra, apo-mdtra and the like. The Maitrl Upanisad mentions 
the word tanmatra in the same context. It can be conjectured that these 
Upanisadic ideas might have influenced the later exponents of the 
Sdmkhya school to explain the evolution of the gross matter from the 
primary tanmatras. 

The generation of the gross matter (in terms of the five elements) out 


of the tanmdtras is as follows 

From hbda (sound) tanmdtras emerges 

dkdh 

From hhda and sparh (touch) „ „ 

vdyu (air)

From sabda, sparh, rupa and „ „ 

ap (water) 

rasa (taste) 

From hbda, sparh, rupa, rasa 

prthvJ (earth) 

and gandha (odour) 



The elements have the following attributes: dkdh (sound); vayu (sound 
and touch); tejas (sound, touch and odour); ap (sound, touch, colour and 
taste); and prthvl (sound, touch, colour, taste and odour). There are two 
noteworthy aspects in this scheme: (i) the attributes are based upon the 
five senses; and (ii) the five elements are thought of in relation to these 
attributes. This integrated concept, therefore, includes the sensorial and 
the gross. The subtle are the tanmatras which have potential power of 
affecting the sense and the gross are the five elements corresponding to 
the five senses. The subtle ones, presumably, have been conceived as the 
ground for the five gross forms. 

According to the Sdmkhya, all gross things are formed by the grouping 
and regrouping of the five elements. The noticeable differences among 
substances are due to the different types of collocations or groupings. It 
may be noted that the Sdrnkhya holds that there can be no production of 
a thing which is non-existent previously, in tune with its theory of causa- 
tion known as the satkaryavdda. In this view, the production means a change 
in the arrangement and that which is potentially present or the unmanifest be- 
comes manifest — a sort of a ‘continual transformation (parindma)*. The 
five elements play their role in this transformation.

A CONCISE fflSTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


The SSrrikhya doctrine of the five elements did influence a great deal 
in the development of certain concepts of the Ayurveda, the principal Indian 
medical system. For, the Ayurveda has adopted the principles of Sdrnkhya 
with certain modifications, bestowing special importance on the five elements 
and their role even in the physiological processes.® 

According to the Ayurveda, the world consisting of the inorganic as well 
as the organic is formed out of the five elements. Even the substances which 
are used as medicines are, as a rule, composed of five elements. The indriya 
or the sensory organ has in it the five elements; only the particular indriya 
will have one element in greater proportion and the other four in relatively 
smaller proportions. The human body is considered as a combination of 
the five elements and soul. 

In the Suiruta Sarnhitd^ there is a clear exposition of the way in which 
the five elements constitute a human body from its very conception. The 
embryo which has in it the energetic principles is separated into form by 
vdyu. The tejas transforms the embryo. The ap bhiita maintains its moist 
structure, while the prthvi tries to give shape and size to it, and keep it intact 
by contributing hardness to it. Akdsa offers expanse to the embryo and 
develops it. Thus comes into play the body or hrira on account of the five 
elements. 

The Ayurveda recognizes five types of substances, viz. dkdfiyadravya, 
vdyavlyadravya, taijasadravya, apyadravya and parthivadravya.^ It should 
be emphasized that, according to the Ayurvedic concept, each of the five 
types of gross bodies contains the particular element in greater proportion 
while the other four are also present in it, of course, in minute but different 
proportions. 

The five elements are also associated with the formation of the six 
rasas, viz. madhura {p^thvl-^apY, (^fnla {tejas -\-prthvT}; lavana {ap-\-tejas)\ 
tikta {dkd^a‘\-vdyu); kafu {tejas i- vdyu); and kasdya (prthvi-\-vdyu),^ Yet 
it should not be understood that the corresponding two elements alone 
constitute a particular rasa; only these two are predominant in it while 
the other three would also enter into its composition. Thus is maintained 
the wholistic nature of the doctrine of five elements. 

The Sdrpkhya enumeration of the five elements should be viewed in 
the light of the Sdrnkhya thought-structure itself. For, according to the 
Sdrnkhya, the material universe emanates out of prakrti which is conceived 
to be the ‘rootless root of the universe*. It is believed to be unmanifest 
and in a state of equilibrium with respect to the three gurtas, viz. sattva, 
raja^ and tamos. Thus, prakjrti, though single, is complex. As a result 
of interaction of puru^a, prakrti is imagined to unfold or evolve itself. In 
this process, matter first in the subtile form and later in the gross form, owes 
its origin to the three gunas. The gunas are the constituent principles 
of the universe, and matter is an offshoot of the intermingling of these three

gunas. The five elements are even recognized in terms of the three gunas 
in different combinations. The gunas, however, are not the qualities of 
prakrti, nor of the elements. They are abstractions bordering on the 
conception of substance. Sattva is that which is light and fine, rajas that 
which is active, and tamas that which is gross and heavy. These postula- 
tions obviously are intended to account for the whole variety of the uni- 
verse as the substratum of change. In this process of change the gums persist, 
only their modes become potent. It would appear that the SUmkhya be- 
lieves in the indestructibility of matter and in the continual operation of 
force in terms of the modes of the perpetually active gums. 


THE VAliESlKA AND THE 

The Vaisesika and the Nyaya systems have their own assessment of 
the five elements. They have given a concise and clear account of each of 
the five elements as follows: 

Prthvi (earth) 

It is of two kinds: eternal and evanescent, eternal in the form of atoms 
and evanescent in the form of products. The latter comprise many sub- 
stances which are commonly perceived. The special quality of earth is 
odour. The earthy products are threefold: (i) in the form of body; (ii) the 
sense organ (olfactory); and (iii) objects of perception. The objects 
include rocks, minerals, various kinds of stones, gems, diamond, etc. on 
the one hand and vegetables, grasses, herbs, trees with their flowers and 
fruits, and other types of plants. Earth possesses fourteen qualities: colour, 
taste, odour, touch, number, dimension, distinctness, conjunction, dis- 
junction, distance, proximity, gravity, fluidity and faculty.® 

Ap (water) 

Like earth, water is also of two kinds: eternal and non-eternal. It 
is eternal in the form of atoms and non-eternal as products. Its products 
are again threefold: (i) body; (ii) sense organ; and the (iii) object. The 
body is in the region of Varuna. The sense organ is that of taste. The 
objects exist as rivers, oceans, hails, moon and the like. The special quality 
of water is taste. Its colour is white. It has also fourteen qualities: colour, 
taste, touch, number, dimension, distinctness, conjunction, disjunction, 
distance, proximity, gravity, viscidity, fluidity and faculty.*' 

Tejas (fire) 

Fire, regarded as white and brilliant, is of two kinds: eternal (atoms) 
and non-eternal (products). The products are also threefold: (i) body 
(which belongs to the region of the sun); (ii) sense organ (visual); and 


“ PBh., pp. 70-71. 


^ PBh., pp. 90-91. 



460 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


(iii) objects which are of four types: earthly, heavenly, stomachic and 
mineral. The earthly fire is that which is perceived ordinarily, such as 
wooden fire. The heavenly is the one observed as sun, lightning and the 
like. The stomachic fire is that which brings about the digestion of food. 
The mineral fire exists in the form of gold and other metals. Fire has 
colour as its special quality. It has in all eleven qualities: colour, touch, 
number, dimension, distinctness, conjunction, distance, disjunction, proxi- 
mity, fluidity and faculty.® 

Vayu (air) 

Air is also eternal (in the shape of atoms) and non-eternal (as pro- 
ducts). The products are of four types: (i) body, existing in the region 
of the Maruts (atmospheric); (ii) sense organ, pervading all over the body 
(tactile); (iii) object (that which is actually perceived as air and is the sub- 
stratum of tactile sensation); and (iv) breath (air in the body which moves 
various fluids and secretions on account of its distinct functions). The 
qualities of air are touch, number, dimension, distinctness, conjunction, 
disjunction, proximity, distance and faculty. Air has motion and the 
motion is transversal (tiryak). It enables the clouds to keep at rest and 
also moves them from place to place. It also causes the showering of rains 
and does not let the weighty substances fall to the ground.^ 

AkQ^a 

While earth, water, fire and air are considered material, the fifth ele- 
ment, akdh, is regarded as non-material, one and all-pervading. Its 
special quality is sound. The auditory organ is of dkasa itself. Its general 
qualities are: sound, number, dimension, distinctness, conjunction and 
disjunction 

It will be seen from the foregoing enumeration that all the knowable 
or sensorial objects are categorized with reference to these five elements. 
In fact, they are generic names signifying the respective atomic states, gross 
matter, senses, the different forms and even attributes. It is interesting to 
note that in the Nydya-Vaiksika classification of the five elements, there 
is a significant relation between the elements and the senses. The visual, 
gustatory, olfactory, tactual and auditory organs are respectively made of 
fire, water, earth, air and dkasa. The principle governing this relation 
seems to be one of ‘like apprehending like’. The eye apprehends colour 
and colour is the specific attribute of fire clement; hence eye must have 
in it the fire element. Likewise tongue apprehends taste and taste is the 
specific attribute of water; hence the element composing the tongue is 
water and so on. However, the principle of Mike apprehending like’ 
seems to find its limitation with reference to the internal organ, namely 
manas. Though manas experiences qualities such as pleasure and pain.

it is not made of any substance which possesses these qualities. The role 
of manas as a substance is discussed later. 

Of great importance is the fact that the Nyaya-Vaiksika view of the 
five elements is a part of its concept of what is designated as dravya (sub- 
stance). Substance is the first of the six categories. The other five are 
gum (attribute), karma (action), samanya (generality), viksa (particu- 
larity) and samavdya (inherence).^* These six categories, it is emphasized, 
arc not subjective notions, nor are they necessities of thought. In the 
Nydya-Vaiksika scheme they are the reals, and a knowledge of them is the 
knowledge of reality. 

Substance is considered to be the most important, as it is the sub- 
stratum (dkaya) for the others. It is of nine types: (i) prthvJ (earth); (ii) ap 
(water); (iii) tejas (fire); (iv) vdyu (air); (v) dkdk; (vi) dis (space); (vii) 
kdla (time); (viii) dtmd (self); and manas (mind).^ The salient features 
of the Nydya-Vaiksika conception of substance is shown on the following 
page. In this plural presentation, the finite and material (prthvi, op, tejas 
and vdyu), the non-material and the ubiquitous {dkdk, dis and kdla), and 
the conscious self (dtmd) as well as mind (manas) have been integrated in 
a rational way. The self is a generic title and includes the individual 
selves. It possesses all-pervasive character and hence has the highest 
dimension without any motion. Mind, the internal organ, is capable of 
bringing about cognition, pleasure, pain and the like. It aids self, of course, 
with the help of the sense organs. Mind is considered to be atomic without 
any specific quality and is believed to possess motion as it cognizes objects 
instantaneously. Both self and mind are essential for experience — one 
having consciousness and the notion of ‘T, the other not having con- 
sciousness, yet nourishing the notion of ‘F. 

The foregoing nine substances of the Nydya-Vaiksika focus an inte- 
grated view on the world-stuff or substance in an ingenious way. It will 
be observed that this conception of substance is inclusive of the attributes 
also. For, it is stated that the attributes cannot exist apart from the sub- 
stance; they inhere in the latter. Yet the substance is not identical with 
or togetherness of its qualities. In this respect the Nydya-Vaik^ka differs 
from the Sdmkhya and also the Buddhist view on matter. 

ATOMISM 

One of the most noteworthy Indian physical concepts is atomism. 
Perhaps it may not be proper to consider this concept chemical or physico- 
chemical for the reason that the Indian atomism is one of speculation, 
based on causal consideration. When the atoms, the primordial stuff 
of the world, unite to form the gross bodies, the process seems to be a physical 
one strictly following a plausible causal mechanism. In this manner the 
Nydya-Vaik^ika, the Jaina and the Bauddha schools have expounded

their atomic concepts. The word used for atom is anu or paramanu. 
Each school has conceived of am or paramanu as a logical necessity to 
explain the physical world in furtherance of its own philosophical ideas. 

THE ATOMISM 

The VaUesika, Nydya and the later syncretic Nydya-Vaise^ika ex- 
ponents are noted for their logically-structured atomism.®’ The 
concept of avayavin (whole) and avayava (constituent part) has shaped the 
atomic theory of the Nydya-Vaisesika. As stated before, the substance is 
considered to be of nine types. Among them, the first four, viz. earth, water, 
fire and air, are considered to be atomic. The atom is indestructible (i.e. 
eternal), indivisible and without any magnitude. Each element has its 
own class of atoms with particular attributes. However, all the atoms 
are regarded as spherical. The four kinds of atoms possess specific attri- 
butes as follows: earthy atom has odour, airy atom — touch, watery atom — 
taste, and fiery atom— colour. By these particular attributes the atoms are 
capable of being differentiated, i.e. qualitatively. 

Constructively, it is the atoms that produce matter of visible magni- 
tude. The process is logically thought of as follows. According to the 
Nydya-Vaisesika, atoms are in eternal motion. As a result, there always 
exists a possibility of combination of any two like atoms, i.e. atoms of 
the same physical substance. It is, however, presumed that the combina- 
tion takes place in the presence of atoms of the other substance or sub- 
stances also. The two like atoms are the material causes for the combina- 
tion while the other types of atoms are considered to play the role of sup- 
portive atoms. Two unlike atoms, i.e. an atom of earth and an atom of 
water cannot, it is stated, enter into combination. 

The effect of the combination of the two like atoms goes by the name 
of dyad (dvyanuka),^ The dyad is also suprasensible as well as infinitesimal 
even though it is formed out of two atoms. The magnitude of the dyad 
is stated to be derived from the number two only. The question is: Why 
is it that only two atoms combine to begin with? Atom is so minute that 
it cannot be a causative component in such a way that it contributes to 
the magnitude of the product. Minuteness, in other words, cannot contri- 
bute to grossness. The atomic magnitude is of the minutest order. Conse- 
quently it can only impart a magnitude which would still be in the same 
order of minuteness. This means that the magnitude of a dyad is not 
superior to that of the two atoms which produce the former. Hence 
the conclusion that the magnitude of a dyad must be derived from the 
number of atoms only. Logically the minimum number of atoms that 
can be causative is two and hence the first product is a dyad. 

In the atomism of the Nydya-Vaise^ika, the dyad, as stated before, is not 
considered as gross matter. In other words, it is invisible. The minimum

visible is a triad, designated as irasarenu or tryanuka^ (of the size of a mote in 
sunbeam). A triad is formed out of three dyads. Nevertheless, the triad 
is not formed directly from six atoms which constitute the three dyads which 
are recognized as the intermediates between the primordial atoms and the 
triad. The atoms as well as the dyads are considered as not having any ex- 
tension in themselves. In addition, they do not possess magnitude on a gross 
scale. These two concepts mean then that the gross magnitude of the triads 
is not due to atoms or the inter-dyadic space, but is due to the plurality of 
dyads. The minimum standard for plurality is again logically three. 
Hence at least three dyads are required for the production of the minimum 
gross matter. Dyads numbering more than three can also enter into union. 
For example, four dyads can combine to form a product, a tetrad. 

As stated earlier, the atoms (six or eight in number) cannot directly 
form a triad or tetrad (caturanuka) as the case may be. For, it is argued 
by the Nydya-Vaisesika that a thing of gross magnitude is formed by those 
which are themselves products. Atoms are eternal, and if they were to 
produce a gross substance like a triad directly, the process would go on 
and the resultant would also be eternal. But the experience is to the 
contrary. This anomaly can therefore be overcome by postulating that the 
dyads, which are the products of atoms and which are neither eternal nor 
indestructible, constitute the triad, tetrad and so on. Thus atoms play 
only one role, i.e. the production of a dyad. They do not have yet another 
role to play, i.e. to produce in addition a triad directly. 

The atomism of the Nydya-Vaisesika is noted for its strict adherence 
to the principle of causality. Atoms are the material cause for a dyad, the 
effect; the dyads are the cause for the production of a triad which is again an 
effect. The atoms lose their causal efficiency after the triad comes into 
existence. In this way, the chain of formation of gross bodies can be 
maintained. The cause in each case brings about the effect, but is imme- 
diately absorbed into the latter which in turn performs the functions of a 
cause to continue the sequence. In dyads the two like atoms do exist; 
only they are devoid of their causative functions. In other words, their 
activities as atoms are exhausted. 

Further the Nydya-Vaisesika atomism has a rational explanation 
for the presence of different qualities in a single substance. A triad of 
earth possesses various qualities because of the presence of different types 
of atoms, say of fire or water. Besides, the structural arrangement (vyuha) 
of a triad, it is said, confers the observed properties on the substance. 

Why do the primordial atoms unite and produce gross matter? The 
explanation given by the Vaisesika is that there is what may be designated 
as the unseen (adr^fa) which sets off this process. Adr^fa as an unseen force, 
then, is the efficient cause of the world while atoms are its material cause. 

It is now fairly certain that the atomic views of the Vaik^ika school 
were in existence even in the pre-Buddhist period. In course of time the

Vaik^ika atomism was developed by a number of its adherents. Among 
them Pra^astapMa, Udyotakara, Vacaspati Misra, Udayapa, Sridhara, 
Jayantabhatta, Sankara Mi^ra and Raghunatha Siromapi threw fresh light 
on this mode of thinking. The atomism had its powerful opponents, too. 
The great Sahkaracarya (r. eighth century a.d.) opposed the atomic views 
in unequivocal terms. Yet even in the late middle ages the atomism was 
very popular among the learned and continued to enjoy a considerable 
following. Even the followers of the Purva-MJmdmsd school, like Prabha- 
kara (probably late seventh century a.d.) and Kumarila (c. eighth century 
A.D.), subscribed to the atomic theory of the Nydya-Vaiksika. In fact, 
Prabhakara introduced the problem of part and whole (avayava-avayavl) and 
recognized atoms as the material cause. In the history of science the 
Vaiksika atomism seems to have gone almost unnoticed while the Greek 
atomism of Leucippus and Democritus (about fifth century B.c.) has earned 
its due position. 

The Nydya-Vaiksika and Greek Atomic Views 

The Vaiksika atomism differs from the Greek atomism in conception as 
weP as formal details. In the Greek atomism, both atoms and void are real. 
The atoms have different sizes and shapes, and they constitute the physi- 
cally indivisible building materials of the universe. Moreover, the atoms 
are held to be in perpetual motion; and thus motion and void are equally 
real. This idea is not found in the Nydya-Vaikkka atomism. While 
the atoms of the Greeks have quantitative differences, those of the Vaiksika 
are noted for their qualitative differences. As mentioned already, there 
are four classes of atoms corresponding to earth, fire, water, and air, each 
class of atoms having different specific qualities. Furthermore, while Demo- 
critus considers that atoms are in eternal motion, the Vaikkka believes 
that they are not in such a state of motion. Only the free atoms at the 
time of creation are recognized to be in motion. Above all, Democritus 
thinks of soul to be composed of atoms and seeks to explain the life pro- 
cesses in terms of atoms. The Nydya-Vaik^ka, on the other hand, re- 
gards soul to be non-material and hence not being composed of atoms. The 
non-material conscious soul is not explained in terms of material un- 
conscious atoms. Besides, there is in Greek atomism a sort of mechanical 
conception of the universe, while such a view is totally absent in the Nydya- 
Vaiksika atomism. The Vaikkka concepts of adrsfa, dkdk, atomic 
dimension, dyad, triad and the like do not have their parallels in the Greek 
atomic views.® 

Now a question arises: historically is the atomism of the Vaiksika 
earlier than that of the Greeks? As mentioned earlier, the Vaiksika 
school is pre-Buddhistic.^ It is reasonable to suppose, therefore, that the 
Vaiksika atomism has its claims for antiquity. But it is very difficult to

say how far the Greeks were influenced by the Indian atomism against their 
philosophical convictions. All that can be said with a fair degree of cer- 
tainty, based on the available evidence, is that the concept of atom is a 
product of an intuitive mind imbued with a spirit of free inquiry. The 
Indian and the Greek thinkers were intuitive and indulged in free inquiry. 
Therefore, the two atomisms might have originated independently of each 
other. 

The Jaina Atomism 

The two heterodox systems, the Jaina and the Bauddha, have devel- 
oped also an atomism, each in its own way and structurally different from 
that of the Nyaya-Vaisesika. The Jaina thinkers discard the doctrine of 
part-whole of the Nydya-Vaisesika, In addition, they maintain that 
atom is both cause and effect — view totally at variance with that of the 
Nydya-Vaisesika. For, the latter asserts unequivocally that atoms are 
the material cause of the world. In the Jaina view, the world is not mere- 
ly a changing phenomena but is beginningless and endless. It is said to 
be composed of two principal categories: jiva (the living) and ajJva (the 
non-living). The latter comprises dharma, adharma, dkdsa, pudgala and 
kdla. Each of them (except kdla) is known as astikdya, i.e. that which 
exists and has pervasiveness, and occupies space or pradesa. A pradesa 
is part of dkdsa occupied by tlie ultimate particle called anu or paramdm 
(atom). The Bhagavatisutra defines paramdm as that which cannot be 
cut or divided.® The atom is also conceived to be the subtlest particle, 
without any parts, even though with reference to its bhdva (condition) its 
capacity is said to change in relation to colour, taste, smell and touch. 
The Jaina atom appears also to be in the nature of a point with reference 
to k§etra or field, and momentary with reference to kdla or time. 

Pudgala is that which undergoes transformations by combinations 
(pud = to combine) and dissociations (gala = to dissociate). It is said to 
possess five kinds of colour (black, blue, red, yellow and white), eight 
types of touch (soft, hard, heavy, light, cold, hot, smooth and rough), five 
tastes (bitter, pungent, acidic, sweet and astringent) and two different odours 
(fragrance and its opposite).^ According to Kundakundacarya, pudgala 
is that which can be experienced by the five senses and has forms or states. 
The two recognized states of pudgala are atomic (am) and aggregate 
(skandha). Amrtacandasuri recognizes six kinds of modifications of 
pudgala, viz. badara-bddardh, badarah, badara-suksma, suk$mabddara, suksma 
and sUk^ma-suksmaS 

The Jaina thinkers believe that two or more atoms combine to produce 
an aggregate. The latter is called skandha, and the physical world is a 
mahdskandha, A skandha may contain two or more atoms. It may also 
be formed by the dissociation of large skandhas. While the atom is abso-

lute and without beginning, the skandha is not absolute and beginningless. 
Two anus produce a dviprade^a (a skandha). Similarly a triprade^a skandha, 
caturpradesa skandha and so forth are thought of. According to the 
Jainas there are also skandhas with countable units {samhatapradeMka), 
uncountable units {asamkhyataprade§ika), infinite units and in finite-fold 
combinations. Further, with reference to vibration and non-vibration, 
there are varieties of skandhas according as the component atoms vibrate, 
non-vibrate, partly vibrate and partly non-vibrate. 

The atoms combine because of their inherent attributes, viz. snigdha 
(attractive force), ruksa (repulsive force) and even snigdhatva-ruksatva 
(attractive-cM/w-repulsive force). These two attributes are natural to or 
inherent in the atoms as well as the skandhas. This is in contradistinction 
to the concept of adfsfa of the Nydya-Vaihsika. According to Umasvatl,® 
combination of similar or dissimilar atoms occurs when there is a difference 
of at least two units of snigdha or riiksa. In other words, the atoms can- 
not combine if they do not have sufficient degree of snigdha or ruksa; nor 
would they combine when they are of equal degree. Likewise, two similar 
types of atoms (say, those which have cohesive forces) cannot enter into 
combination. In a refreshing approach, the Jaina appears to hold the 
view that a combination means the coming into play of the cohesive and re- 
pulsive forces which are natural to the atoms. 

Further, each atom is said to possess the attributes (bhdvas) of touch, 
taste, odour and colour, even so potentially; for pudgala, composed as it is 
of atoms, possesses these attributes. According to the Jaina view, these 
four qualities associated as they are with what is called vyavahdra para- 
mdnu in contradistinction to the indivisible suksma paramdnu, are also 
capable of being divided. While the atoms of the Nydya-Vaisesika differ 
from one another qualitatively, the Jaina atoms are all similar without 
any qualitative or quantitative differences. In short, they are of one class 
without any distinction such as, earth-atom, water-atom, etc., like those 
of the Nydya-Vaisesika. Thus every atom is capable of producing any 
colour, odour, taste and touch. However, it is believed that, in relation to 
the attribute of a skandha, the corresponding atoms may have attributes 
also. 

The atom, according to the Bhagavatlsutra,^ is endowed with one 
colour (black, blue, red, yellow or white), one taste (bitter, sour, astrin- 
gent, acidic or sweet), one smell (pleasant or unpleasant) and two touches 
(cold and cohesive, warm and cohesive, cold and dry or warm and dry). 
However, the atom is not considered to be heavy or large, but light {aguru- 
laghu) in its own state. There is no matter lighter than atom.*^ The at- 
tributes are present in every atom to an equal extent, participating in trans- 
formations and aggregations. It is of interest to note that the Jaina thinkers 
do not regard the aggregate (skandha)2is a new substance, but as a special form 
of the aggregation of atoms which are infinite in number. A noteworthy

aspect of the transformation is that, as atoms are devoid of shape, no 
transformation with reference to shape is possible. Evidently the atoms 
experience increase or decrease in their attributes. There could be infinite 
groups of transformations even though there are admittedly (5 x 5 x 2 X 4) 
two hundred basic such groups.® In the Jaina view the atom is not 
always active. It sometimes vibrates or revolves itself in a regular (samita) 
or irregular (aniyamita) way. The motion of atom when it proceeds from 
one point of space to another is considered to take place in a straight line. 
Some of the Jaina texts like the Bhagavatlsutra^ Pannavana and Sthanahga 
siitra discuss in considerable detail the vibration of the atom from the 
point of view of time, its dissociation from skandha, resistance encountered 
in its activity and the like. 

It would appear that the Jaina concept of pudgala and of atoms is 
a well-knit part of the religious speculation; for, the Jaina believes that karma 
is also composed of subtle particles of matter and that these particles find 
their path into the soul which, as a result, becomes corrupt. Jlva is be- 
lieved to take in such pudgalas as are productive of karma. And Jaina 
thinkers have given an elaborate account of how the karmapudgalas flow 
into jiva and how soul and atom can exist together in one space-point. 
It is even pointed out that wherever tliere is an atom, there are one unit of 
dharmdstikaya and one unit of adharmdstikdya. In understanding the 
Jaina atomism these aspects have to be kept in view. 

The most important aspect of the Jaina view of matter, however, is 
that matter exists eternally and does not remain in the atomic state as if 
to signify the beginning or to mark the end. This means, then, that the Jaina 
atoms represent a stage in the natural process. In other words, they are not 
the ultimates of gross matter. The Jaina atom, in addition, is a deter- 
minant of the period of time according as it experiences motion from one 
point in dkdsa to the immediate next point. 

The Bauddha Atomism 

There does not seem to be any account of atomism in the old canon- 
ical Buddhist works. The four principal Buddhist schools are: Vaibhdsika 
and Sautrdntika (belonging to the Hinaydna sect), the Yogdedra and the 
Mddhyamikd (belonging to the Mahdydna sect). The Mddhyamikd school 
does not subscribe to the reahty of matter. The Yogdedra also declares 
that the external world is not real. Hence both these schools are opposed 
to the atomic theory of matter. The Vaibhdsika and the Sautrdntika 
which are regarded as the realists {sarvdstitvamdins) admit the atomic state 
of matter within their philosophical views. They have elaborated on 
atomic view of matter as a part of their concept of rupa.^ They consider 
matter as collocation consisting of the fourfold substratum of colour, 
taste, odour and touch, and regard atom as the minutest unit of rupa (that 
which has the capacity to afiect sense organs).

According to these Buddhists, the atom is ‘indivisible, unanalysable, 
invisible, inaudible, un testable and intangible*. However the Bauddha 
atoms are momentary in the sense they undergo phase-changes con- 
tinually. There are two types of atoms: simple (dravyaparamanu) and 
compound (samghdtaparamdnu). Nevertheless, some different views have 
been expressed concerning their aggregation. Some believe that it is a clean 
combination; others think that there remains always an intervening space 
between the atoms; and yet others view that they are in such a close proxi- 
mity that there is no inter-atomic space. In the ultimate analysis, it would 
seem that the Bauddhas do not think of a combination of the modern 
chemical type between the atoms. By and large, they appear to hold the 
view that gross matter is a conglomeration of independent atoms (a sort 
of a cluster having one atom at the centre and the others around it), and 
that the latter are not hollow and hence cannot penetrate one another. 

According to the Buddhists, there are in an aggregate eight atoms — 
four fundamental and four secondary atoms. The fundamental ones 
are of earth (solid), water (liquid), fire (hot) and air (moving). The 
secondary atoms are of colour, odour, taste and touch. Thus in this scheme 
the qualities are also atomic. Moreover the Buddhists seem to regard 
organs of sense as modifications of atomic matter. Each secondary atom 
requires four fundamental atoms for its support. The aggregate therefore 
consists of 20 atoms (4 x 4+4) if the body does not sound. If it is to sound, 
the aggregate will consist of 25 atoms.® 

The Buddhists do not speak of atoms in terms of particles of some 
stuff; instead they think of them as force or energy thus: earthly atom- 
force of repulsion; watery atom-kinetic energy.^ All these forces are 
considered to be present in all things and in the same proportion. Different 
types of bodies (say liquid or solid) are perceived because the intensity 
of the force-content of the different elements varies, even though the pro- 
portionality of the elements remains unaltered. The Buddhist view of 
atoms as dynamic forces is in tune also with the doctrine of momentariness 
which unequivocally states that all things change and everything is momen- 
tary. (‘All things without exception are nothing but strings of momentary 
events’). The so-called permanence or stable existence of objects which 
are perceived in the ordinary way is indeed a function of our thought- 
process. What is ultimately real is instantaneous being. As things have 
momentary existence, i.e. as they disappear as soon as they appear, the 
Buddhists do not consider motion with reference to matter at all. But, 
as Santiraksita says, ‘The essence of reality is motion. Reality is indeed 
kinetic ... the interdependence of the moments following one another, 
evokes the illusion of stability of duration, but they are forces (samskdras) 
flashing into existence without any real enduring substance in them . . . 
An everlasting substantial matter is pure imagination*. The atomism of 
the Buddhists should be viewed in this light also.

A CONCISE ilJSlORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


ATTRIBUTES OF MATTER 

Of all the systems of Indian thought, the Nyaya-Vaisesika has laid 
considerable emphasis on the attributes of matter. The Nyaya-Vaiksika 
holds that the qualities or attributes do not have separate existence, but 
reside in the substances. Each substance is a substratum for certain attri- 
butes, The Vaik^ika sutra mentions seventeen such attributes. Later 
its celebrated exponent, Pra^astapada, has added seven more. As a result, 
twenty-four attributes are enumerated. These attributes are: colour, 
taste, odour, touch, number, dimension, distinctness, conjunction, dis- 
junction, priority, volition, virtue, vice, gravity, fluidity, posteriority, in- 
tellect, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, viscidity, faculty and sound.® 

Each of the nine substances has a number of attributes from among 
the aforementioned twenty-four. Those of the first five substances, viz. 
earth, water, fire, air and akak, have been mentioned already. The attri- 
butes of the other four substances are as follows: kdla (time; 5 qualities): 
number, dimension, distinctness, conjunction and disjunction; dis (space; 
5 qualities): number, dimension, distinctness, conjunction and disjunction; 
dtmd (self; 14 qualities): cognition, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, effort, 
virtue, vice, faculty, number, dimension, distinctness, conjunction and disjunc- 
tion, and ntanas (mind; 8 qualities): number, dimension, distinctness, con- 
junction, disjunction, priority, posteriority and faculty. 

Again the specific attributes, viz. sound, touch, taste and smell, are 
perceived by the respective sense organs: There are five general qualities: 
number, dimension, distinctness, conjunction and disjunction which are 
possessed by every substance. Among the twenty-four qualities some are 
physical in nature while a few belong to the realm of mind and the notion 
of ‘r. Some of the important physical qualities are briefly set out below: 

Gurutva {gravity) 

The Nydya-Vaiksika holds that gravity is the cause of falling*' when 
there is no conjunction or self-reproduction of motion. Though imper- 
ceptible, gravity can be inferred from the action of falling. The falling 
of rain water is considered to be due to gravity. The Vaiksika thinks 
that gravity resides in the object as a whole and not in its parts. The 
body of a man does not fall because gravity is said to be counteracted by 
the effort of the man to keep standing. An object placed high up does 
not fall because of its conjunction with its support. The arrow which is 
shot out in air does not fall to the ground because of the impetus it 
possesses, and the impetus neutralizes the effect of gravity. The theory of 
impetus of the Vaiksika has been discussed later. Gravity is supposed 
to be eternal as well as temporary. The gravity of the atoms of earth 
as well as of water is considered eternal, while the gravity of the products 


“ PBh., p. 229. 


PBh., p. 640. 



THE PHYSICAL WORLD: VIEWS AND CONCEPTS 


471 


or of the gross bodies is regarded as evanescent, i.e. the latter is destroyed 
by the destruction of its substratum. 

From the foregoing it would appear that the Vaisesika regards gravity 
not as a force, but as a qualitative causal factor with the act of falling as 
its effect. Though the word gurutva has the connotation of heaviness or 
weight, there seems to be no correlation between gravity and the mass 
of the substance. Among the substances only earth and water are sup- 
posed to possess gravity. In other words, gravity is not considered as a 
property of all ponderable substances. 

Dravatva {fluidity) 

Fluidity is considered to be the quality of the three corporal sub- 
stances— earth, water and fire. It is the cause of the action of flowing in 
the same way as gravity is the cause of the act of falling. Fluidity is of two 
types: natural and incidental. The former is the specific property of water. 
Even so water is said to lose this quality on becoming a solid in the form 
of snow or hail. There is even a view that the fluidity of watery atoms 
is brought about by some external agency like subtle supernatural fire. 
Strangely, salt is considered to be aqueous in nature because in course 
of time it ‘melts into an aqueous form’ (possibly referring to the prop- 
erty of deliquescence due to the presence of magnesium chloride in com- 
mon salt). Likewise, fire is also regarded as a substance possessing the 
quality of fluidity, for fluidity of melted butter or gold is caused by fire.® 

Snigdha {viscidity) 

As a specific quality of water, viscosity or viscidity is the cause of 
cohesion and smoothness. As a result of this quality, agglutination or a 
holding together of particles {pindihhdva) occurs in the form of a lump. 
In other words, viscidity counteracts any tendency of the particles to dis- 
perse. Thus it is an operative cause of conjunction against a possible 
tendency of disjunction. Water is said to possess this property because 
the particles of earth or flour, for example, are agglutinated in contact with 
it to form a dough.^ 

Sthitisthdpaka {elasticity) 

Elasticity is a particular kind of the attribute, samskdra (faculty). It 
is a quality of only the earthy substances which have their component- 
particles packed together. It is this property that is responsible for a bow, 
a thread or a branch of a tree which can undergo contraction or expan- 
sion. It would appear that elasticity is thought of as a cause or force 
bringing about a come-back to the original condition in an object which 
has already experienced the opposite state.^^

A CONCISli HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


Samyoga and Viyoga or Vibhdga (conjunction and disjunction) 

As stated already, these two attributes belong to all the nine substances. 
Conjunction denotes the ‘joining together* of two substances already 
lying apart. It may be a result of the action of one or both the objects. 
In the former case, an active object, say a flying bird, comes in contact 
with an inactive one, say a tree or hill. In the latter case, there is collision 
of two things moving in opposite directions. Conjunction thus means that 
there is no intervening space between the two objects. In addition, it 
connotes that there is non-separate existence of two individual substances. 
What is more, it is an event in time. Pressure and impact are also thought 
of as two special kinds of conjunction. Pressure is a type of contact of a 
body with another; it produces a sort of a motion without at the same time 
bringing about a disjunction between the two bodies. Thus pressure is 
a contact which persists. On the other hand, the impact brings about a dis- 
junction of the two bodies after the event of conjunction and hence does 
not persist. It is evident that conjunction and disjunction are thought of 
in terms of relating principles.® 

In conclusion, it should be emphasized that the attributes, as con- 
ceived by the Nydya-VaiksikOj are not arbitrary. The twenty-four attri- 
butes already mentioned are so chosen that they could explain the know- 
able properties of the phenomenal world as well as of the knower himself. 
This is in keeping with the integrated view of the Nydya-Vaisesika 
concerning the world of reality. 


MOTION 

In the Indian view of the physical world, the idea of motion is of funda- 
mental importance. For, it is believed that motion is necessary not only 
for the creation of the world but for its destruction even. In other words, 
both conjunction and disjunction, of cosmic or atomic order, are inherent in 
a substance which serves as the substratum of motion. The characteristics 
of motion, according to the Nyaya-VaikfikOy are: (i) one kind of motion 
is possible at a time in one substance; (ii) the substance experiences motion 
from without; (iii) motion exists only for a few moments; (iv) it is pro- 
duced by infinite substances with limited forms; (v) it has no quality and 
(vi) it is destroyed by the effect it produces in a particular direction. The 
Vaik^ika sutra says that motion is non-eternal and has the character of 
being an effect and a cause. In particular, it is the cause of velocity and 
elasticity. 

It has been mentioned earlier that one of the six categories of the 
NyHya-Vaiksika system is action (korman). Action is thought of in terms of 
throwing upwards (utk^epana), throwing downwards (apaksepana\ contrac- 
tion (dkuncema), expansion (prasdrana), and going (gamana)} In fact, the five 
actions represent the Nydya- Vaik^ika concept of motion . Evidently, in these 


» m., pp. 649 If. 


^ VS., 1 , 1 . 6 . 



THE PHYSICAL WORLD: VIEWS AND CONCEPTS 


473 


five actions what distinguishes the one from the other is the direction in which 
the action takes place. Throwing upwards and throwing downwards arc 
obviously vertical motions in opposite direction brought about by effort. 
Both contraction and expansion are explained in terms of conjunction 
and disjunction of particles in space. Gamana is motion in general in any 
direction. It is conceived of in terms of conjunction or disjunction 
with points of space in diverse directions. It is quite clear that in this 
scheme, motion has not been conceived with reference to both space and 
time. 

The Vaiksika holds the view that matter in its atomic or gross state 
is intrinsically static. The inert matter is set in motion by some quality 
present in it. For example, the falling motion is due to the quality of 
gravity present in it. The quality of fluidity is the cause of flowing. Even 
throwing upwards or downwards is caused by the quality, effort. Gamana 
takes place as a result of the two qualities, viz. conjunction and disjunction. 
In the case of atomic matter the position appears to be different. It is 
pointed out that only the free atoms which exist at the time of total destruc- 
tion of the universe are in motion. The first cause of this motion is held 
to be adrsta (the unseen). In the Nydya-Vaikkka concept of motion, 
adrsta seems to occupy an important position. Even some of the natural 
movements like attraction of needle by magnet, flow of air, upward rise of 
sap in the plants, etc., are considered to be due to adrsta.^ 

The motion of free atoms caused by adrsta is responsible for the coming 
into being of the material world. The free atoms have two types of 
motions— creative and non-creative. The former causes conjunction of 
atoms eventually giving rise to gross bodies. The latter, on the other 
hand, brings about occasional grouping of atoms. 

The Vaikkka holds that when a body moves its motion belongs to 
itself and to no other. One event of motion cannot produce another 
motion; i.e. it cannot initiate its own kind of motion. This means that 
perpetual motion is impossible. A body can have at a particular moment 
one unit of motion which just produces the minimum possible change 
in the positions of the body. How then could the body have continued 
motion? In this respect the concept of samskara, one of the attributes, 
is of great significance. There are three forms of samskara, namely yega 
(impetus), bhdvand (mental impression) and sthitisthdpaka (elasticity).*^ 
The last has been dealt with already. The second is non-physical in 
character and hence does not merit attention at this stage. The Vaiksika 
concept of vega is important in this respect that it signifies the idea of 
momentum, for vega is stated to be not only caused by motion but also 
is recognized as a cause of motion. According to Vyoma^ivacarya and 
Sridhara, vega is caused by nodana (impelling push), ahhighdta (impact) 
and sarnyuktasarnyoga (forces which set in compound conjunction)*’. It 
is, therefore, reasonable to suppose that vega is produced by a force or

NK., p. 647. 



474 


A CONClSIi HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


an effort and becomes the cause of continued motion in a particular direc- 
tion until it is smothered by external situations or forces. 

In general, the position of the Vaiksika is that when a body experi- 
ences the first unit of motion caused by impelling push, impact and the 
like, samskara or impetus is possessed by it. On account of this impetus, 
the body continues to move in the same direction. It is pointed out that 
the impetus is capable of producing the effect to the same extent and in 
the same direction as the cause by which it is itself produced and that the 
body is in motion as long as it possesses the impetus, and the direction is 
not altered. Thus the impetus maintains the direction of the motion. 
However, when the moving body comes into contact with an obstacle 
which would neutralize the quality of impetus, it comes to rest. If, instead, 
the obstacle cannot neutralize the quality of impetus in full, the motion 
continues of course with diminished strength. 

A causally connected descriptive account of motion of a javelin thrown 
by hand, an arrow shot from a bow, and of pestle and mortar is found 
in the Prahstapadabhasya and the Nyaya-kandall of ^ridhara.'* In the 
case of the motion of a javelin, the desire of the person engaged in the 
operation with consequent volitional effort results in conjunction of the 
hand with the javelin and an impelling push. The latter imparts motion 
to the javelin as well as an impetus. When the javelin leaves the hand, 
i.e. when the disjunction takes place, the impelling push becomes ineffec- 
tive while the impetus causes the motion of the javelin, the direction and 
the distance traversed by the javelin being dependent upon the extent or 
quantum of the volitional effort applied, resulting in an impetus. 

In the case of discharge of an arrow from a bow-string, the desire 
and the effort operate resulting in a motion in the form of drawing of the 
string by hand as well as in the arrow and the string. Again, the desire 
and the effort to discharge the arrow produce disjunction between the string 
of the bow and the finger. At this stage, samskara of the type of elasticity 
present in the bow tries to restore the original form of the bow. Aided 
by this elasticity, a motion is produced in the string as well as in the arrow 
which is now impelled by the string. The impelling push produces \ega 
in the arrow, the moment the arrow leaves the string. The arrow then 
continues to move because of the vega and, when the latter is exhausted, 
becomes subject to the action of gravity and falls to the ground. 

In respect of the movement of a pestle,*' the cause is explained also 
in terms of desire and volitional effort, conjunction and disjunction. The 
volitional effort results in an upward motion in the hand first and in the 
pestle later. Now the desire for downward motion occurs and the corre- 
sponding volitional effort produces the downward motion. It is pointed 
out that the upward motion caused by the impact of the pestle with the 
mortar is involuntary. In other words, the downward action sets in a 
reaction and it is the latter that brings about the upward motion in the 


NK., pp. 700-706. 


* Mishra (U.) (1), pp. 210-11. 



THE PHYSICAL WORLD: VIEWS AND CONCEPTS 475 

Opposite direction. The point worthy of note is that the impact of the 
pestle with the mortar as well as the continuance of the upward motion for 
some time is explained in terms of vega. 

The Vaisesika explanation of the motion of objects is obviously quali- 
tative, considering as it does the motion in terms of change with reference 
to space only. Nowhere does it appear to take cognizance of another 
mode of perception with respect to motion, i.e. time. The general idea 
is that motions arc caused by qualities in the substance. This is in 
keeping with the position that actions and qualities cannot be considered 
without their substratum, viz. substance. 

The falling motion of a body has been examined in considerable detail 
by the Vaiksika. In the case of a body falling vertically due to gravity 
it is believed that gravity causes the initial falling, and impetus, too, is said 
to be produced concomitantly. Even though the downward motion 
becomes subject to the combined action of gravity and impetus, the 
explanation offered by the Vaisesika does not appear to have the connota- 
tion of acceleration at all. It would appear that gravity which causes the 
first unit of motion from which arises the impetus, becomes ineffective, 
and the subsequent falling motion is considered to be due to impetus alone. 
Gravity as understood by the Vaisesika should not be confused with the 
modern concept of gravity. It may be reiterated that in the Vaisesika 
school gravity is a quality having a causal function with falling as its effect. 

Historically, the impetus theory appeared in Europe, only in the 
fourteenth century a.d. though John Philoponus of Alexandria had put 
forward a similar view as early as the sixth century a.d. In India, how- 
ever, the impetus theory is unmistakably recognizable in the Prakski- 
padabhasya {c. fifth century a.d.) and the elements of the theory can be 
found in the Vaiksika sutra which, as indicated already, is prc-Buddhistic 
(c. seventh century B.C.). 

AkASa, space and time 

Among the Indian physical concepts those relating to dkdk, space 
and time deserve special mention. As has been seen, earth, water, fire 
and air are material substances; as produced substances they are non- 
eternal. However, in the form of atoms they are eternal. On the other 
hand, dkdk, space and time are non-material, eternal and all-pervading 
even though they are grouped along with the first four under the category 
of substance. 

Among the three, it is dkdk alone which has a special quality like 
the first four, and its specific quality is sound. This specific quality, how- 
ever, exists only in some part of the ubiquitous or all-pervading dkdsa 
at a particular instant, while the specific qualities of the other four sub- 
stances respectively pervade in them. Another aspect of dkdk is that 


Bhaduri, pp. 164-228. 



476 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


though non-material, it is recognized as one of the five elements, and thus 
is capable of playing its role in the formation of gross bodies. All cor- 
poreal substances are held to be in direct contact with dkdsa which is a 
vast expanse or an infinite continuum. The auditory organ is also re- 
garded as of dkdsa itself as a logical necessity. For, if the auditory organ 
is to experience the quality of sound of which dkdh is the substratum, the 
organ itself must be in the very nature of dkdsa. 

Space and time differ from dkdsa in this respect that there is no specific 
quality for each of the former. Both space and time have, however, the 
other five qualities as dkdsa, viz. number, dimension, distinctness, conjunc- 
tion and disjunction. As indicated already, these five qualities which are 
regarded as generic, are shared by all the nine substances. 

The Nydya-VaUesika holds that space is the cause or basis of the 
ten notions of east, west, north, south and the like with respect to one 
material object relative to another material object as the starting point 
of the limit. For the sake of usage the ten literal names like east, west, 
etc., are coined with reference to the contact with the reference-body, viz. 
sun. Even so, space is regarded as one, eternal and all-pervading. Space 
appears to have been conceived by the Nydya-Vaisesika as a positionally 
relating one, providing an arrangement or order to discrete objects so 
that their positions become intelligible. Because of space the corporeal sub- 
stances are cognized as occupying different places. Distance is not under- 
stood as parts of stretch of space, but thought of as number of conjunc- 
tions with reference to the observer. If the number of conjunction is 
more between the observer and a particular object than it is with another 
object, the fomer is observed as being prior to the latter. The transitive 
principle which relates the two objects and which points out their posteri- 
ority or priority, is space. Thus space is not a mere receptacle into which 
bodies are filled here and there. It is an objective reality possessing certain 
qualities. However, the qualities like remoteness, proximity imply an 
observer as a frame of reference. The presence of an observer is necessary, 
but not sufficient condition; for, according to the Nydya-Vaisesika, the 
object has to be in conjunction with space which is a real substance. 

Like space, time is another real which is the cause or basis of produc- 
tion, persistence and destruction of all produced things. It is also the 
basis for common notions such as ksana, lava, kdsthd, mdsa, rtu, yuga, 
kalpa, pralaya and mahdpralaya. Priority (aparatva) or posteriority (paratva) 
as a quality of the produced things resides in it with reference to the number 
of solar revolutions (adityaparivartanani). One complete revolution of 
the sun round the earth (equivalent to a day) is one solar revolution which 
is the basis or standard of reference. If A is regarded as prior to B and 
if A and B are existing, it means that the former must have been connected 
with a greater number of solar revolutions than the latter. Time is the 
relation or the linking factor between the unit and the universal solar 
revolution. It is therefore objectively real. Besides, time is essential as

the efficient cause of notions such as ‘youth’, ‘old’, etc. In other words, 
because of time, the growth and decay in material objects are perceived. 

Time is thought of in diverse ways on account of the diversity of such 
situations as production, continuance and disappearance of all things. 
Events derive their chronological order on account of time. The past, 
present and future are empirical divisions of time. The coming into being 
of an effect indicates the future; its persistence means the present; and 
its destruction connotes the past. The notions of past and future are 
with reference only to the present, according to the Nyaya-Vaisesika. 
In this interpretation, time is reckoned in terms of its kriya or action also.® 
The present relates, say in the case of falling object, the action of falling 
and the object; the past means that the connection between the object 
and the falling action is over; and future refers to such a connection yet to 
materialize. 

Space and time have many things in common in the Nydya-Vaiksika. 
Yet they are distinctly separate substances, even though they possess 
the same qualities. The difference lies in interpreting time on the basis 
of action while space is not conceived of that way. 

The Jainas, in general, believe that time is ajlva (non-conscious) and 
without any kdya^ but eternal and without motion, even though some 
thinkers among them differ from this viewpoint. The present, past and 
future are referred to by the Jainas as phenomenal time, vyavahdra kdla 
or samaya, i.e. they are intimately connected with certain events or pheno- 
mena bringing about changes. Obviously this is ‘relative-time’.^ The 
Jainas also think that there is yet another time known as nikayakdla, i.e. 
noumenal time. The noumenal time is the basis or support {adhdra) of 
the phenomenal time. Besides, it is the cause of changes in substances 
and without it no change is possible. In sum, the Jaina view of time is 
not wholly different from that of the Nydya-Vaiksika. However, there 
seems to be one important difference, viz. the Jainas (the Digambaras) 
do not consider time as one and all-pervasive. Instead they hold that 
there are distinctive time units corresponding to distinctive human 
experiences. They are the ultimate time-units, called kdldmSy i.e. atoms 
of time — as indivisible as atoms, discrete and infinitesimal. Each kdldnu 
is supposed to occupy only one pradesa and hence kdla has no "kdya\^ 

While the Nydya-Vaikkka and the Jaina schools recognize the abso- 
lute reality of time, the Buddhists and the followers of Sdmkhya and the 
Vedantins deny the objective existence of time. The followers of the Yoga 
school of Patanjali seem to accept only ksana (i.e. moment) as the ultimate 
unit of time and imagine an uninterrupted flow of these ultimate units. The 
Vedantins regard time as of nescience {avidyd), i.e. time has no reality. 

In addition to the foregoing, there are a number of other views 
about time. For example, the celebrated Purdnas speak of time as all- 
powerful Deity. The Yoga Vdsikha says that time and space are relative

thought-models which are dependent upon mind. A few tantrik texts con- 
sider time even as &akti which governs creation, persistence and destruction. 
But these views deserve only passing mention. 


HEAT AND LIGHT 

HEAT 

Conceptually, heat and light are sought to be understood in relation 
to one of the five elements, viz. fire (tejas). As has been seen, according 
to the Nyaya-Vaisesika school, the element fire is material; eternal in the 
form of atoms and non-eternal in the form of products. The atomic 
view of the element fire, is generally maintained in the case of heat while 
the atomic as well as the wave nature of fire, in the case of light. 

What happens when a body is heated? The Vaisesika and the Nyaya 
schools have considered this problem in considerable detail. It is well 
known that when a fresh earthy pot is subjected to the action of heat its 
colour changes, generally into red, and the body of the pot hardens. The 
Vaiksika believes that these changes or fresh attributes take place at the 
atomic or the particulate level. The Naiayikas, on the other hand, hold 
the view that they occur in the body as a whole. The former is known 
as pllupakavada (argumentation concerning the heating of pilus or particles) 
and the latter, pitharapakavada (argumentation concerning the heating 
of the body as a whole).® In either case, during heating what happens is 
that the fire element plays the active role. The element is considered to 
be in high motion, producing forcible contact {abhighata) with the object 
heated. According to Udayanacarya, the fire element is so light and 
moves with such high speed that it is capable of causing a rupture of the 
original structure of the body when subjected to heat. 

Pllupakavada 

The pllupakavada envisages the action of heat at various stages. When 
an earthy body (pot) is heated, the fire element enters into it with great 
force, thus setting into motion the earth-atoms. Udayanacarya says that 
the impact is so strong that the motion produced by the fire element results 
in the destruction of the previous structure {vyuha). As a result, disjunction 
of atoms takes place, i.e. the dyads are split and atoms become isolated. 
At this stage, fire destroys the original colour of the earth-atoms which, 
as a result, attain a native state. Fire now produces in them the red 
colour. Afterwards, the unseen force {adcs(a) causes conjunction of atoms 
into dyads which ultimately form, through triads, the pot once again. 
This is evidenced by the fact that before the action of heat the constituent 
parts of the pot are not hard, while they do become hard after heating. 


Mishra (U.) (1), pp. 92-95. 



THE PHYSICAL WORLD! VIEWS AND CONCEPTS 


479 


Though a series of events takes place, the Vaisesika holds that the original 
shape of the pot remains the same. 

Another interesting aspect of ( the pilupakavada is that the whole 
process is enumerated in terms of distinct stages, and the time necessary 
for attaining each stage is reckoned in terms of moments — nine, ten or 
eleven.® The heating process involving ten moments, broadly, is as follows: 
(i) motion produced in the atoms, and isolation of atoms; (ii) destruction 
of the original colour; (iii) production of the red colour; (iv) destruction 
of the motion of the atoms produced earlier; (v) production of the creative 
motion between the atoms; (vi) disjunction between the atoms and akasa\ 
(vii) destruction of the conjunction produced earlier; (viii) coming into 
being of productive conjunction; (ix) production of the dyad; and (x) pro- 
duction of the red colour in it, and formation of the triad. Likewise, 
details are also given of processes involving nine or eleven movements. 
Tlicre are even processes involving six, five, four or three moments, in 
consonance with the dilferent stages of the processes reckoned. What is 
of importance in this scheme is that the colour of the pot is produced by the 
colour of the triads which owe their colour to the constituent dyads which, 
in turn, owe it to the colour of the atoms themselves. 

Pitharapakavdda 

According to the pitharapakavdda which sets forth the view that 
the colour change takes place in the entire body of the pot, i.e. the pot 
in the oven or the furnace remains structurally intact. It does not undergo 
any change in size or shape, and the invisible process of disintegration at 
the level of atoms is wholly untenable. 

These two views obviously try to explain a common phenomenon on 
logical grounds without going into the quality or quantity of heat itself. 
The idea relating to the differences in the sources of heat is also not thought 
of. Different types of fuels are stated to be different forms of fire. There 
is a view held by Vijhana Bhik§u that heat is latent in the fuel and under 
favourable conditions it breaks forth. Udayanacarya has given expression 
to a more rational view that the solar heat is the source of all forms of heat 
manifested.^ 

Another aspect of the element fire vis-d-vis what is known as pdka 
deserves consideration. Pdka, in general, seems to connote conjunction 
of the element fire in different ways with earthy substances. For example, 
when a mango fruit is kept surrounded with straw, the heat produced 
changes its colour from green to yellow without affecting the taste of the 
fruit. This is a case of conjunction involving fire element. Similar types 
of conjunctions are possible resulting in the change of taste, smell and 
touch. The Nydya-Vaisesika tries to explain different transformations 
such as production of milk from grass, formation of curd, cream, etc., on 
the basis of conjunction involving fire atoms.

LIGHT 

In respect of light, the concept found in the Nyayasutra of Gautama 
and elaborated upon by Vatsyayana in the Nyayabhasya deserves special 
mention.® How is the object perceived by the eye or the visual organ? 
As noted before, the element fire is the principle of the visual (sensory) 
organ. Its prominent qualities are colour and touch, while its special 
quality is colour. It is pointed out that the light rays emanate or issue 
forth from the eye and get into contact with the objects, large or smaU, 
in the same way as there occurs the contact between the light ray (going 
out from the lamp) and the object. The rays which issue forth from the eye, 
if obstructed by an intervening object, cannot have the direct contact with 
the object. Hence the latter cannot be perceived in such a situation. 

Then how is the colour perceived? Perception of colour is stated 
to be the result of the presence of several components and also the character 
of colour itself. In addition, the character of the colour should become 
manifest, in order that it be perceived. The light rays coming out from 
the eye have their colour umnanifested. Hence they are not perceived. 
Light, in general, is stated to possess a diversity of character, viz. (i) both 
colour and touch manifested (sun’s rays perceived by eye and skin); 
(ii) colour manifested but touch unmanifested (light from the lamp or 
moon seen by eye only); (iii) touch manifested but colour unmanifested 
(as in hot water); and (iv) both colour and touch unmanifested (rays from 
the eye itself). 

The view regarding the perception of objects larger than the size of 
the eye is very interesting. According to the Nydya-Vaisesika, just as 
tejas of the burning wick of a lamp gradually spreads out in ever increasing 
circles and illumines the objects of various sizes, so also the tejas in the 
eye goes out and spreads in wider circles apprehending the objects of 
different sizes. It is held by the Mlmdmsakas^ that, like a ray of light, 
the stretch of vision also goes on expanding gradually, the range of vision 
depending upon the extent of the stretch. The extent of this stretch itself 
is said to terminate at the object, perhaps encompassing it. It is even 
stated that the vision of the rays emanating from the eye would not proceed 
beyond the object in view. 

The Mlmdmsakas also think that the flame is the collection of a large 
quantity of light particles at the burning zone, say wick, and that the light 
particles are in a state of high motion. Further, they even recognize a 
sort of radiation diffused by the flame, proceeding away from the burning 
wick. 

As regards reflection, a curious view is expressed by the followers 
of the Nydya school. The mirror is beheved to be possessed of a par- 
ticular colour as an intrinsic part of its very nature. When a man stands 
before it, the light rays emanating from the eyes strike the mirror and are

THE PHYSICAL WORLD I VIEWS AND CONCEPTS 


481 


turned back. Again they establish contact with his own face. The re- 
flected image is perceived as a result of the peculiar colour of the mirror’s 
own surface.® 

It will be seen from the foregoing observations that the speculation 
concerning light centres round the fact that the rays issue forth from the 
eye itself to establish contact with the object. The contact-theory, as it 
may be called, seems to derive its sanction from (i) the fact that the principle 
of visual organ is tejas (fire) and (ii) an observation that the light rays appear 
to emanate from the eyes of ‘night-walkers’, i.c. cats and other feline 
animals. The Nydyabhasya asserts that there is no justification for the 
assumption that there is a difference of character between the eye of the 
cat and the human eye.^ 

Of particular interest are the different views about the characteristics 
of the visual sense organ itself. The Nydya-Vaisesika holds that the eyes 
arc produced mainly from the ultimate particles of tejas so that they 
apprehend colour alone. It is pointed out that this particular type of pro- 
duction is rendered possible by adrsta. The Buddhists, however, believe 
that the blue eyeballs represent the visual organ. These eyeballs, which 
are material, perceive the external objects because of external light and 
the past deeds of the observer. They do not subscribe to the idea that 
the visual organ moves up to the object of perception at a distance. In 
respect of the number of visual organs, too, there are differing views. The 
author of the Nydyabhasya, Vatsyayana, states that there are two inde- 
pendent eyes and hence two sense organs of sight. Udyotakara, in his 
Nydyavdrtika, asserts that there is only one organ of sight. This view 
is supported by the later exponents of the Nydya-Vaisesika like Vacaspati 
Misra and Vi^vanatha as well as by the Buddhist, Vasubandhu. 


SOUND 

There are different views about the production and propagation of 
sound. The followers of the Nydya-Vaisesika school consider sound 
as a quality. The substance in which sound subsists as a special quality 
corresponding to the auditory sense organ, is dkdsa. In the Nydya- 
Vaisesika view sound is a produced phenomenon having a beginning as 
well as an end. Even so, it is not believed to be coeval with the substance 
in which or by which it is produced, because experience reveals that sound 
moves out of the substance. 

Two types of sound are recognized: (i) articulate and (ii) noise in 
general. The first is considered as the one that proceeds from mind and 
self. An effort on the part of the subject brings about the conjunction 
of the self with air. This conjunction produces in air a certain movement. 
The air then strikes the region of throat to produce letter-sound, i.e. the 
articulate one, in contact with dkdsa. 

“ 1 . 50 .

482 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


The noted exponent of the Vaik^ika school, Pra^astapada,® is of 
the view that sound is produced always in series which may be likened 
to the series of water ripples. It has been stated that these wave motions, 
ripple-like as they are, occupy successive points in dkd:ia. The first sound 
causes the second one. As soon as the latter is formed, the former (as 
the cause) gets destroyed. This kind of production and destruction goes 
on in a chain, and what is perceived by the ear is the last of the series. In 
other words, the first sound so produced and, for that matter, the inter- 
vening ripples of sound, are not heard. Yet in this way the auditory organ 
is said to be connected with the source of sound through the successive 
movements. The latter are indeed a result of the cause and effect relation- 
ship. The first movement is the cause with the second as the effect, the 
second is the cause with the third as the effect and so forth. 

When a drum is struck by a stick the impact is believed to set up 
vibrations as a consequence of which sound is produced in all directions. 
The mechanical impact is held by the Nydya-Vaisesika to be the efficient 
cause while dkdsa alone is the true substratum of sound. Further, while 
dkdsa is an eternal substance, sound is a transient quality because it is 
related to the notion of being produced and destroyed. 

The position of the followers of the Mmdmsaka^ school is entirely 
different in this respect. They believe that sound is eternal and not a 
produced phenomenon. The movement of the air and the perception 
of sound appear to have been linked together by the Mimdmsakas. Owing 
to an effort, say when one speaks, the internal air is said to acquire a 
certain forceful movement and reach the dkdsa of the ear, thus imparting 
to the auditory organ a faculty or potency. It is only when this faculty, 
imperceptible as it is, occurs that sound is heard. The changes perceived with 
reference to the intensities of sound are believed to be due to the fluctua- 
tions in the air-current itself. In this way the Mimdmsakas explain the 
propagation of sound while strictly maintaining the eternality of sound. 
This is in line with their philosophical position, viz. that hbda or word 
(Veda included) is real and eternal. 

The Jainas believe that sound is neither a substance nor an attribute 
of dkdsa, but is a sort of a modification of matter.® When the skandhas 
or aggregates of atoms come in contact with one another sound is said to 
become manifest and travel as such to the ear. The Sdrfikhya view is that 
the auditory organ as a part of the all-pervading dkdsa expands imper- 
ceptibly into the region where sound is produced. And dkdsa itself is 
formed out of the tanmdtras (subtle states) of sound. 

It will be observed from what has been stated above that the Nydya- 
Vaik^ika school alone tries to explain the phenomenon of sound in a 
causal sequence. The other schools attempt to accommodate the pheno- 
menon into their philosophical views.

THE PHYSICAL WORLD: VIEWS AND CONCEPTS 


483 


In the end, emphasis may be laid on some important aspects of the 
particular Indian physical concepts in relation to the history of science. 
The earliest reference to the concept of natural law can be found in 
the Jigveda. Likewise the doctrine of elements is probably earlier than 
that of the Greek thinkers. This doctrine in some form or the other exerted 
considerable influence on different Indian systems of thought including the 
Cdrvdkas. Atomism, which was a significant mode of thinking among the 
followers of the Vaisesika, Nydya, Jaina and the Bauddha schools, as 
mentioned already, developed on logical lines. 

The Vaisesika system has played an important role in the growth of 
physical ideas in India. It had assumed a definite shape by the sixth 
century B.c. In the history of science, sixth century b.c. has been regarded 
as the period which heralded the dawn of what has now come to be known 
as the Greek Science. The Vaisesika system contains in it the most impor- 
tant ideas on matter and motion, enunciated later by some of the leading 
Greek thinkers including Aristotle (from the beginning of the sixth century 
to the close of the fourth century b.c.). Among the Greeks there were 
distinctly separate views and explanations of the knowable world. But 
there appeared no single system of the type of Vaisesika among the Greek 
thinkers. 

It is not a mere historical situation that the Vaisesika system presented 
in an aphoristic style certain physical concepts at an earlier period, and 
that later there were similar ideas streaming along independently among 
the Greeks. It is probable there was then a movement of ideas as the 
Greeks and the Indians came together before and after Alexander’s invasion. 
Even some learned historians of science have unhesitatingly suggested that 
the origins of some of the Greek ideas can be traced to India also. It 
is very likely that the Vaisesika school, in its systematized form, might 
have attracted and stimulated the like-minded people elsewhere including 
the Greek thinkers.® 

Lastly, the Nydya-Vaisesika concepts present an integrated view of 
the world-stuff or substance. The four material elements (earth, water, 
fire and air), the three non-material {dkdsa, space and time), the conscious 
self and the internal organ, mind, constitute the substance. This inte- 
grated conceptual presentation is of particular significance from the point 
of view of modem scientific epistemology. For, the latter is still unable to 
clarify the conceptual inadequacies concerning substance. 


Subbarayappa (2), pp. 21-34. 




WESTERN SCIENCE IN INDIA UP TO 
THE END OF THE NINETEENTH 
CENTURY A.D. 


B. V. SUBBARAYAPPA 


The growth and ramification of several scientific thoughts and technological 
practices dealt with in the preceding chapters reveal, on closer analysis, 
that the Indian culture-area occupied a distinct place in the history of 
science during the ancient and medieval periods. A comparative study of 
the Indian scientific thought with that of Europe shows that, while Europe 
was passing through the Dark Age from about the fifth to eleventh 
centuries a.d., India had her period of glory in the Classical Age and made 
remarkable progress in such fields as mathematics, astronomy, iatro- 
chemistry and metallurgy, even right up to the twelfth century a.d. There- 
after the creative endeavour showed signs of decay due largely to the 
traditional compulsions and political vicissitudes. 

Traditionally, the free involvement of different productive classes did 
not materiahze as a result of caste distinctions on the one hand and a sort 
of mutual aloofness among various branches of production on the other. 
The profcssionalists — the artisans and craftsmen — engaged themselves in 
their respective productive operations practically without any communi- 
cation with one another. They could not in addition receive the necessary 
educational training. Thus training of the mind did not go side by side 
with the training of the hands. Moreover, the latter was passed on from 
one generation to another within the rigid structure of caste-governed 
professionalism which became eventually detrimental to the augmentation of 
mobility which alone could foster changes in techniques. More often than 
naught it was a return to the hereditary practices whenever forces of change 
raised their heads. Undoubtedly, the Indian artisans possessed the in- 
genuity to produce outstanding pieces of workmanship in the seventeenth 
and eighteenth centuries; for the Indian manufactures were of a high 
order and enjoyed reputation in the adjoining as well as remote countries. 
Nevertheless, the ingenuity of the artisans depended, for its fuller expres- 
sion, upon the stimuli received from the social framework of the times. 
Subservient as they indeed were to the higher and exploiting sections of the 
society, and hierarchically existing as they did as one of the lowest social

strata, the artisans were in no fortunate position to receive encouragement, 
from outside or inside, which could nourish and augment their inventive 
capabilities. Moreover, the craftsmanship, by and large, went by birth, 
and there was even a certain amount of rigidity among the craftsmen them- 
selves, which was not permissive of cementation with any veneer of excel- 
lence outside its tradition. 

Politically, a sense of insecurity seemed to have been round the corner 
of the Indian society in the later medieval period. Naturally this affected 
the merchant class as well as the artisans. The former could not rear 
large productive organizations, and necessarily their commercial assets 
went underground in the form of gold and silver, jewels and other orna- 
ments. Medieval India was indeed rich in these metals. The Frenchman 
Bernier who travelled in India from 1656 to 1668 says: ‘It should not escape 
notice that gold and silver, after circulating in any other quarter of the 
globe, come at length to be absorbed in Hindostany Gold and silver came 
to India from America, England, Portugal, France, Holland, Turkey, 
Yemen, Iran, etc., in exchange for the Indian manufactures, while the 
importation of articles into India did not occasion the export of gold and 
silver, the returns being again in the form of the Indian merchandise. 
Even so, the wealth of the country did not result in any industrial invest- 
ment, leading to productions on a large scale. There were no doubt enter- 
prising business houses in different parts of India. But the political up- 
heavals which came up frequently on the scene acted as a drag on the 
growth of an industrial middle class. One of the results was that the 
Indian craftsmen could not be engaged in large numbers under the umbrella 
of big industrial production. Their work remained as handicrafts, depend- 
ing upon the whims of their patrons. Such a situation was inherently in- 
capable of bringing prosperity to the craftsmen who were really poor, 
catering out of necessity to the rather inhuman tendencies of the patrons 
including merchants. According to Bernier again: ‘The protection 
afforded by the powerful patrons to rich merchants and tradesmen, who 
give the workmen rather more than the usual wages, tends also to preserve 
the arts. I say rather more wages; for it should not be inferred from the 
goodness of the manufacturers, that the workman is held in high esteem, 
or arrives at a state of independence. Nothing but sheer necessity or blows 
from a cudgel keeps him employed; he never can become rich, and he feels 
it not a trifling matter if he has the means of satisfying the cravings of hunger 
and of covering his body with the coarsest raiment. If money be gained, 
it does not in any measure go into his pocket, but only serves to increase 
the wealth of the merchant who, in his turn, is not a little perplexed how to 
guard against some act of outrage and extortion on the part of his superiors.’^ 

The social milieu, as noted above, was in the least conducive to any 
technological innovation. As to the scientific ideas, the traditionally 
fostered learning was confined to a select class of people who preferred to

preserve it with diligence and care only in the nature of elaborate com- 
mentaries. Thus ensued an in-breeding in scientific thinking and, in effect, 
the creative spirit of India was at its lowest ebb from the twelfth to almost 
the middle of the nineteenth century a.d. 

It is true that India had absorbed already some of the Chinese practical 
arts such as alchemy, paper-making and pyrotechnics. But the Chinese 
culture-area was in no better position to provide further stimuli which 
could make inroads into the Indian scientific thinking and practice. The 
intellectualism of Arabic science with which India had close links shifted 
to Europe and, by the twelfth century a.d., Spain, the westernmost province of 
the Islamic world, developed into a meeting ground of Arabian, Jewish and 
Christian thoughts, with such Indian elements as were assimilated by the 
Arabian men of science. In the succeeding two centuries it was Europe 
which provided a social situation, as will be seen below, that was favourable 
to certain new intellectual endeavours. India could well have looked to 
Europe and derived inspiration from what was happening in Europe then. 
But, again, the political and social factors appear to have overpowered the 
knowledge-seekers and innovators, with the result that India had to wait 
patiently till the western science was introduced by the Europeans who 
came as traders first and governed the country later. 

RENAISSANCE IN EUROPE 

The nomenclature, western science, is intended here to mean that 
spectacularly fruitful activity commonly referred to as the modem science, 
which developed its first roots in the intellectual efflorescence of some 
western countries in Europe notably Italy, France, England and Germany 
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries a.d. It is well recognized that 
western science owes its origin to the Renaissance (Fr. renaitre; Lat. rena- 
scari: to be born again) which some of the European countries experienced 
in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries a.d. The reason is not far 
to seek; for the Renaissance, marked as it was by an outburst of indi- 
vidualism, a spirit of free enquiry and new intellectual vigour, produced a 
stimulating effect on the methods of investigating or inquiring into the 
observed phenomena. The traditional and authoritarian views which 
held the ground for centuries were subjected to searching rational analyses 
and, as a result, the old theories began to yield place to the new. In con- 
sequence, new concepts of matter and motion, an equally new way of 
reasoned interpretation of the astronomical observations, fresh approach 
to the study of physiology and the like, devoid of religio-philosophical 
undertones, emerged. It should be emphasized that the Renaissance itself 
was an effect of several influences which converged at that time. Although 
opinions may differ on the exact factors which were causative of the Re- 
naissance, it is interesting to note that ‘while it is true that the countryside 
gains by the habitual presence of its natural leaders, yet, in an age of slow 
communication, country life gives little opportunity for the contact of

mind with mind which leads to intellectual culture and creation. On the 
other hand, the city life of the leisured and intelligent classes in northern 
Italy gave an ideal environment for the birth of the Renaissance*.® Further, 
there was in that period an increase in commerce and an expansion of urban 
living. The artists and craftsmen became a part of the urban population, 
having had their share of prosperity and recognition by the widening upper 
classes who possessed the requisite wealth for material well-being. The 
new world was under exploration, and the newly acquired treasures gave 
leisure and comfort for intellectual pursuits. The navigation with the use 
of astronomical instruments and the abiding interest in cartography brought 
about not only a widening of the horizon of the physical world but also of 
human intellect. In particular, astronomy, mathematics, medicine and 
mechanics assumed new dimensions, meriting serious and imaginative 
attention. 


WESTERN SCIENCE AFTER THE RENAISSANCE 

The three centuries, sixteenth to the eighteenth, constitute the most 
important formative period in the development of modem science. The 
work of Gilbert (1546-1603) on magnetism, the importance of recording 
all available facts leading to the formation of general laws by induction as 
emphasized by Francis Bacon (1561-1626), realization of the importance of 
new mathematical methods for studying physical phenomena as stressed 
by Rene Descartes (1596-1650), the rise of mechanics and astronomy due to 
the bold approach to them of Galileo (1564-1642) and Newton (1642-1727), 
the work of Harvey (1578-1657) on the circulation of blood, morphology 
of the stellar universe, discovery of oxygen, overthrow of the caloric theory 
of heat, wave-nature of light, and the study of current electricity, were among 
the most spectacular landmarks of the period. The nineteenth century 
began with the enunciation by Dalton of the atomic theory which afforded a 
new interpretation of matter and motion. The nature of electromagnetism 
and the work of Faraday on electricity had a profound impact upon the 
knowledge and application of the new form of energy. Towards the middle of 
the century the law of conservation of energy was established on firm grounds. 
Furthermore, the biological world acquired a new meaning by permitting a 
penetrating insight as a result of the theory of evolution propounded by Dar- 
win. Both the physical and biological sciences advanced rapidly in the latter 
half of the nineteenth century providing new knowledge of alike macrocosm 
and microcosm. The closing two decades of the century witnessed some re- 
markable experiments which led to the discovery of X-rays and radio-activity. 
More significantly, a break-through occurred in respect of the atomic struc- 
ture, velocity of light and energy distribution in a black-body spectrum. In 
the early decades of the twentieth century, these gave birth to revolutionary 
concepts concerning atomic matter, energy, space, time and motion.

It may be emphasized at this stage that the innate strength of modern 
science lies in its method. For this reason, its character and validity are 
not governed by any geographical or religio-philosophical positions, which, 
in the ancient and medieval periods, admittedly impinged upon the science 
of a nation or culture-area concerned. The scientific method comprises 
the induction which enables formulation of general laws of nature by recog- 
nizing uniformity in a set of observations; and deduction which helps 
arrive at inferences of even the unobserved ones from relevant observations. 
There is yet another aspect of the scientific method which, in general terms, 
relates to the formulation of hypothesis founded on the analysis of a limited 
number of observations, and testing its validity by further observations of 
predicted occurrence, or by means of specially devised experiments of such 
nature as are based on some theoretical projections. 

The foregoing, though briefly sketched, gives an idea of the origin 
and manifold development of science, based on the scientific method, in 
the western countries up to the end of the nineteenth century. Alongside, 
it must be noted that the industrial technology marched ahead, particularly 
as a result of the Industrial Revolution which occurred in Britain in the 
middle of the eighteenth century in the wake of the invention of important 
machinery or mechanical aids, exploitation of mines and effective utilization 
of steam power. New factories grew up and the new modes of produc- 
tion even changed the complexion of the social structure. Faraday’s 
work on electricity soon led to its application to industries and lighting 
systems. Chemical industries were established in increasing numbers, and 
the natural resources exploited for human benefit. 

The finished products which developed export potential engendered a 
new economic movement in different parts of the world. Thus, western 
science and the associated industrial enterprise could not be contained in the 
countries of their origin. They began to diffuse, slowly but steadily, to 
the new lands, both in the East and the West, some of which gradually 
became their economic and political colonies. 

A close examination of such a diffusion of western science from the 
European countries reveals certain important trends, as indicated in a 
recent study in terms of a three-phase model.® First, the European, for 
reasons commercial or political, comes into direct contact with the new 
land and becomes deeply involved in investigations of the latter’s flora, 
fauna, minerals and the like, on which he brings to bear the training in and 
knowledge of systematic observations which he had witnessed earlier in his 
own culture-area. Thus, in the beginning, botanical, zoological and geologi- 
cal explorations appeal to him more than any other branch of modem 
science, and the fresh knowledge gained by him in the process is fed back 
to the European savants engaged in such investigations. Secondly, there 
spring up in the new land a number of institutions and scientific establish- 
ments which noticeably become instrumental for widening the range of

investigations, even so well within the knowledge and training obtaining 
then in the European countries. In the third phase, the new scientific 
endeavour acts as a stimulus and attracts the intellectuals among the natives, 
thus laying the foundation for the promotion of modern science in the new 
land. 

Historically it is interesting to note that in the latter half of the 
eighteenth century, the biological explorations stimulated interest in the 
natural history of even far oflf lands such as India, Australia, Antarctica and 
the Malayan Archipelago. In addition, the commercially important plants 
and minerals of the new lands held out great promise for the European 
trading companies which in their own interest encouraged systematic in- 
vestigations. The European naturalists, too, were eager to add to their 
knowledge of botany, zoology and geology by visiting the new countries 
concerned. 


EUROPEAN TRADERS AND MISSIONARIES IN INDIA 
The Portuguese 

The early European traders to have reached India across the seas round 
the Cape of Good Hope were the Portuguese; and this happened towards 
the close of the fifteenth century. In 1510 they occupied Goa (the first 
Portuguese base on the Indian soil) and soon built up a dominion on the 
western coast. From the point of view of the history of the implantation 
of western science on India, mention should be made of Garcia da Orta 
(1479-1570), the Portuguese physician and botanist who came to Goa in 
1534 and spent the rest of his life of 36 years in western India. He grew 
in Goa a botanical garden in which he nursed a number of medicinal 
plants. He studied scientifically the flora of the region. His work entitled 
Colloquies dos simples e drogos de cousas medicinais da India compostos 
pelle Doutor Garcia da Orta, which was printed in India in 1565, contains 
an account of the local plants and fruits.® Apart from Garcia da Orta, 
we know very little of the other investigators, nor of the attempts made by 
the Portuguese authorities to bring to India the western scientific knowl- 
edge. It may, however, be noted that some new types of plants which 
included coffee, tobacco, maize and the like were introduced into India 
during this period. Thus in the sixteenth century India was able to receive 
and nurture a few western botanical elements. 

The Three East India Companies 

The beginning of the seventeenth century saw the formation of two 
East India Companies — one in Britain (1600) and the other in the Nether- 
lands (1602), for trading in the East. The former, under the name ‘The 
Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East

India’, was granted a Charter by Queen Elizabeth I on the last day of 1600. 
This Company traded at first with the Spice Islands, and it was only in 
1608 that it could send its first vessel to Surat. The latter, under the name 
‘The United East India Company of the Netherlands’, set foot on the Malabar 
Coast a little earlier. The French East India Company came into being 
in 1664. The European naturalists, medical men, engineers and other 
technical men who came out to India in association with such commercial 
and trading enterprises were responsible in no small measure for the intro- 
duction of western science in India. Of them, as will be seen later, the 
British, after establishing their supremacy in 1757, played a great role in 
not only establishing a number of scientific and technical institutions but 
also promoting scientific investigations in India. 

Jesuit Missionaries 

The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries also witnessed the entry into 
India of a number of Jesuit missionaries (belonging to a religious order of 
the Roman Catholic Church, founded in 1534 by Ignatius Loyola) who 
carried with them the then prevalent learning in Europe in astronomy, 
geography and natural history. Unofficial agents as they indeed were of 
the Portuguese Company trading in India, the Jesuit missionaries were also 
active in the political field particularly in the Mughal court. Fathers 
Antonio Ceshi (mathematician), Johann Grueber and Albert d’Orville 
(astronomers), Bouchet, Mandeslo, Noel, Boudier, Figuerado, Gabelsperger, 
Strobl and Tieffenthaler (geographers) spared no efforts in furtherance of 
their knowledge in the respective sciences. Some of them were associated 
with the astronomical observatories of Sawai Jai Singh early in the 
eighteenth century. To what extent their knowledge of western science 
was able to influence the local pandits and rulers cannot be said with certain- 
ty. Likewise, in what form the Indian scientific ideas which they carried 
with them to Europe were assimilated into the then evolving scientific 
knowledge is a moot point. However, in the field of geography of India 
the latitude and longitude measurements which were determined scientifically 
by some of the Jesuit missionaries contributed not a little to the geographical 
knowledge of India. 


SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS DURING 
THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES 

The first glimpses of modern scientific investigations that India had 
were those concerning its natural treasures and features. The flora and 
the fauna, minerals, geographic characters, climatic conditions and the 
like attracted the attention of the versatile Europeans who were either in 
the employ of the trading companies or independent missionaries and 
explorers. Some of them were trained scientists while the others went about 
with almost an insatiable thirst for the natural knowledge of the coimtry. 



WESTERN SCIENCE IN INDIA 


491 


In the eighteenth century, the commercial policies of the Britishers 
gave considerable encouragement to the study of the economically important 
plants, minerals and other natural products of India. Moreover, the 
country’s climatic as well as geographical knowledge, essential for military 
purposes, was an important factor. Thus the British East India Company 
prudently promoted botanical, meteorological and geological investigations, 
as well as a survey of India on scientific lines. To begin with, the investi- 
gators were obviously Europeans; and Indians could get into them only 
after the country had a system of scientific and technical education which 
trained them. The following is a brief account of some of the important 
scientific efforts made in India in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. 

BOTANICAL STUDIES 

In Europe, the botanical investigations in the early seventeenth century 
were mainly confined to the collection and identification of plants, their 
classification and study of morphology. The European naturalists who 
came to India during this period were, by and large, either physicians, 
administrative officers or missionaries, who acquitted themselves as efficient 
collectors and classifiers of the Indian flora.® 

When the Dutch took possession of the Malabar Coast from the 
Portuguese, the Dutch naturalists evinced keen interest in the flora around 
them. The Governor of Dutch Possessions, Heinrich Van Rheede tot 
Drakenstein (1637-1692), studied a number of plants and seeds with the 
help of the European surgeons with whom he came in contact and also the 
Malabar medical practitioners whom he employed for the purpose. He 
was perhaps among the first to get the illustrations of a number of plants 
drawn. His work, Hortus Malabaricus, was published in 12 volumes 
(Amsterdam, 1686-1703) with 794 plates.*^ It is significant that on this 
work Karl Linnaeus, the renowned Swedish botanist, based the nomen- 
clature of the Indian plants in his Species plantarum. 

On the Madras Coast at this time the two Britishers, James Petiver, 
who was an apothecary, and Charles Du Bois, who was an employee of the 
East India Company, were engaged in the collection of plants. Petiver 
used to send the material to the Westminster physician, Leonard Plukenet, 
who spared no efforts to publish the copperplate illustrations of them under 
the name Phytographia.^ On the Madras Coast was also working a Dane, 
Johan Gerhard Koenig (1728-1781), who had worked earlier with Karl 
Linnaeus. Koenig joined the Tranquebar Mission as a surgeon in 1768, 
and later became the Natural Historian of the East India Company in the 


® It would appear that up to the end of the nineteenth century there were as many as 
457 persons interested in the botanical explorations, among whom 104 were surgeons 
or physicians and 111 were administrative officers. — ^Burkill, p. 232.

Madras Presidency. It would appear that he formed a small group in- 
terested in botanical studies under the name ^The United Brothers’® who 
used to collect plants, exchange specimens and send them to Europe for 
ensuring proper nomenclature and description. According to King:^ 
‘Three of these brothers, Heyne, Klein and Sottler, were missionaries 
located near Tranquebar. Gradually the circle widened and, before the 
century closed, the enthusiasm for botanical research had spread to the 
younger Presidency of Bengal, and the number of workers increased to 
about 12, among whom may be mentioned Fleming, Hunter, Anderson, 
Berry, Roxburgh, Buchanan and William Jones’. On his part, Koenig 
made huge collections of plants and used to send specimens to the Univer- 
sity of Lund in Sweden. In addition, he introduced Linnaeus’ binomial 
system of nomenclature in India. 

ROYAL BOTANIC GARDEN 

In the history of the botanical and horticultural investigations in India, 
a special significance attaches to the role of a garden known as the Royal 
Botanic Garden^ (now Indian Botanic Garden). As the former President 
of the Royal Society of London, Joseph Banks said:*^ ‘The Botanic Garden 
was established with fourfold purposes of conferring economic benefit to 
the region, increasing their resources in food and raw materials, importing 
from other parts of the world newer types of plants of economic importance 
and acclimatizing them here, as well as for extending the interesting science 
of natural history and particularly botany.’ The garden came into existence 
as early as 1787 at Sibpur on the west bank of the river Hooghly under 
peculiar circumstances. At Calcutta, the Burma teak was being used to 
build freight vessels and this posed a challenge whether teak could be 
grown near Calcutta or not. Robert Kyd, who was then Secretary to the 
Military Department of Inspection, suggested that an attempt be made to 
grow teak in a botanic garden, and chose an extensive area for the garden, 
just opposite to where he lived. A trial was then made to grow teak in about 
40 acres. Now enjoying an extensive area of about 300 acres,® the Botanic 
Garden (earlier popularly known as the ‘Company Bagh’ denoting that it 
belonged to the East India Company) represents the devoted and systematic 
efforts of a number of botanists. Robert Kyd, who had raised a small 
garden himself and who was noted for his horticultural interest, became the 
first Honorary Superintendent of the Garden, and introduced some 300 
species in the Garden which evidently was the first of its type at that time. 

Well aware of the importance of the economically useful indigenous 
plants, Kyd recommended to the government to establish a nursery stock 
of plants and later disseminate such of them as were extremely beneficial to

those who would cultivate them. In such an attempt he saw an extension 
of Indian commerce, and increase in national income. The East India 
Company, too, was not unaware of the benefits of this scheme. While 
whole-heartedly approving the proposal, the Company laid special emphasis 
on the cultivation of the commercially beneficial cinnamon; Kyd tried 
to grow several kinds of economic plants during his six years of office. 

After the death of Robert Kyd in 1793, William Roxburgh, who was 
then the East India Company’s naturalist in the Presidency of Madras, 
was appointed as the Superintendent of the Garden. Roxburgh who had 
already established himself as a naturalist of indefatigable energy was 
noted for his discovery of the indigenous pepper plant at Samulcotta (Goda- 
vari district of Andhra Pradesh). To him the Garden owed a great deal 
for its flourishing form in the first decade of the nineteenth century, as will 
be seen later. 


SURVEY 

The political ambitions of the East India Company was, perhaps, 
largely responsible for organizing extensive survey work with a view to 
gaining a thorough geographical knowledge of the subcontinent. Never- 
theless, as already noted, the Jesuit missionaries and the European travellers 
who wandered in India possessed some geographical details. Some maps 
revealing the geography of India, which were published in Venice, Holland, 
France and England, were based on the traditional ideas and the accounts 
of some mariners and travellers. In 1723, the French geographer Delisle 
published a fairly accurate map of the southern coasts of India. Earlier in 
1719, Father Bouchet, a French Jesuit missionary, prepared a rough inland 
map of southern India and from this the well-known geographer Bourgignon 
d’Anville (1697-1782) pubfished in 1737 his first map of south India, and 
in 1752 a comprehensive map. Cane de Vlnde, at the request of the French 
East India Company.^ However, it was the Britishers who initiated in 
Bengal a scientific survey for ascertaining the geographical knowledge as 
accurately as possible. And they could do so after their victory at the 
Battle of Plassey in 1757. 

In 1761 Plaisted began the survey work on the coasts of Chittagong. 
About the same time Hugh Cammeran surveyed the ‘New Lands’ of the 
24-Parganas, His successor, James Rennell, conducted the survey of the 
Ganges river (1764) with a view to finding a waterway for up-country 
traffic from Calcutta. In recognition of his imtiring work Rennell was 
appointed by Clive and his Council as the Surveyor-General (1767). By 
1777 Rennell and his co-workers had surveyed the Company’s possessions 
in Bengal and Bihar including the Assam frontier. The first Map of Hindoo- 
stern was prepared by Rennell in 1783. T. D. Pearse of the Bengal Artillery 
and R. H. Colebrooke recorded a series of observations of latitude and 
longitude (1774-1795). The other Presidencies— Madras and Bombay—

were not lagging behind in their efforts towards surveying the strategically im- 
portant geographical parts. In the Presidency of Madras, Robert Kelly (1738- 
1790) and Michael Topping (1747-1796) were the pioneers. Kelly attempt- 
ed to cover the south peninsula with an atlas of degree sheets compiled 
from measured routes. Topping, who founded the Madras Observatory 
(1792) and the Surveying School (1794), advocated ‘a continuous series of 
triangles that should be spread throughout India’,® and endeavoured to 
prepare a 300-niile line of triangles along the coast from Madras to Palk 
Straight. Even though he did not have the necessary knowledge of geo- 
desy, Topping appeared to have favoured a trigonometrical survey of 
India. Collin Mackenzie of the Madras Engineers, who placed the topo- 
graphical survey (i.e. delineation of the natural and other features of an 
area) on a solid foundation, was well known for his survey of the Deccan 
including Mysore. Towards the close of the eighteenth century substantial 
progress was made in both the land and coastal surveys. Some parts of 
Upper India were also surveyed notably by Frederick Sackville (Bundel- 
khand), Francis White (Delhi), Colebrooke (Rohilkhand) and Webb (Oudh 
and Gorakhpur). James Blunt surveyed Cuttack and produced a valuable 
map. Nevertheless, all these could not assume an all-India character even 
towards the close of the eighteenth century as they were scattered and dis- 
joined. 


METEOROLOGICAL RECORDINGS 

The usefulness of carefully recorded meteorological observations was 
noticed long time back by the Europeans — seamen, astronomers, medical 
officers, engineers and even administrators — who were in different parts of 
India, not unoften moving from one place to another. As early as 1784, 
a meteorological diary was maintained at Calcutta by one Henry Trail.^ 
Thomas D. Pearse was another who, at Calcutta, recorded the observations 
of the barometer, thermometer, hygrometer, wind direction and rainfall 
during the period 1785-1788.® Medical officers were also expected to keep 
meteorological journals at their stations. In 1789 William Hunter recorded 
observations on the rainfall and climate of Ujjain. However, it was in the 
nineteenth century that systematic recordings over regular periods at a 
number of stations became possible, as will be seen later. 

THE MADRAS OBSERVATORY 

An important institution which came into being in the closing decade 
of the eighteenth century was the Madras Observatory established in 1792 
on the initiative of Charles Oakeley, the Governor of Madras, ‘for promot- 
ing the knowledge of astronomy, geography and navigation in India’. 
Earlier, William Petrie, a Member of Madras Government, had set up an 
observatory, probably the first of its type in the East, at his own expense.

He transferred his instruments and other equipment to the Madras Ob- 
servatory. John Goldingham, a Fellow of the Royal Society noted for his 
astronomical acumen, was the first astronomer who worked at the ob- 
servatory and recorded a number of astronomical observations, as will be 
observed later. 


THE ASIATIC SOCIETY 

In the last quarter of the eighteenth century, the European investi- 
gators who were engaged in antiquarian studies, as also in diverse investi- 
gations of the natural history of India, felt the need for meeting together 
with a view to exchanging notes, promoting learned discussions and com- 
municating their own findings. This necessitated the founding of a learned 
society, and it did not take long to establish one such. Thirty European 
intellectuals of Calcutta met on 15 January 1784, under the Presidentship 
of Robert Charles, the second judge of Supreme Court, and resolved to 
form an association called ‘The Asiatick Society’® (later known as the Asiatic 
Society of Bengal and this name was changed in 1936 to ‘The Royal Asiatic 
Society of Bengal’) and to hold weekly meetings every Thursday at 7 o’clock. 
But the mind behind this attempt was that of William Jones, a versatile 
literary genius and scholar of repute in Latin, Greek, Arabic and Persian. 
In recognition of his linguistic attainments he was already elected a Fellow 
of the Royal Society in England before he came to India in 1783 as a puisne 
judge of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal. 
Jones became the Founder-President of the Asiatic Society and continued 
to be its President till his death in 1794. 

Objects 

The objects of the Asiatic Society were stated in an ornate style by 
William Jones in his opening address as follows: ‘You will investigate 
whatever is rare in the stupendous fabric of nature, will correct the geo- 
graphy of Asia by new observations and discoveries, will trace the animals, 
and even traditions, of those nations, who from time to time have peopled 
or desolated it; and will bring to light their various forms of government, 
with their institutions, civil and religious; and you will examine their im- 
provements and methods in arithmetic and geometry, in trigonometry, 
mensuration, mechanics, politics, astronomy and general physics; their skill 
in surgery and medicine and their advancement, whatever may be in ana- 
tomy and chemistry. To this you will add researches into their agriculture, 
manufactures and trade, and whilst you enquire into their music, archi- 
tecture, painting and pottery. You will not neglect those inferior arts, by 
which comforts, and even elegances of social life, are supplied or improved.’^ 

Indeed the canvas of investigations was wide; for not only did it em- 
brace the letters, sciences and arts, the inanimate rocks and the animate

fauna and flora but even covered a wide range of human thinking and 
reflections. In fact Jones himself said: ‘If now it be asked, what are the 
intended objects of the enquires within these spacious limits, we answer: 
Man and Nature — whatever is performed by the one and produced by the 
other within the geographical limits of Asia.’ 

William Jones 

William Jones himself set an example in this direction. He became 
well versed in Sanskrit and threw fresh light on the antiquity of the Indian 
Zodiac, the lunar year of the Hindus, the Hindu chronology, Indian plants, 
etc. He prepared a catalogue of the Indian plants with their names both 
in Sanskrit and Linnaean generic nomenclature. To perpetuate the botani- 
cal interests of William Jones, Roxburgh estabhshed the genus Jonesia Roxb. 
(Sarca L.). A man of deep culture, Wilham Jones did signal service to 
the furtherance of oriental and scientific pursuits in India by establishing 
the Asiatic Society. He died at an early age of forty-eight in 1794. During 
his stay in India, short as it was for about ten years, the Asiatic Society 
steadily progressed towards its becoming a premier society of its type in 
Asia. There was no Indian as member of the Society when it started. 
However, now and then, papers written by Indians used to be presented. 
In April 1785, a paper in Persian entitled ‘The Care of the Elephantiasis and 
other Disorders of the Blood’, written by a Muhammadan medical man, 
was translated into English by Jones himself and presented by him to the 
Society. It was only in 1829 that a few Indians were elected as members 
of the Society for the first time. 

The Asiatic Society had no building of its own for twenty-four years. 
As long as Jones was alive, the meetings were held in the Grand Jury 
Room of the old Supreme Court. It was only in 1808 that the Society was 
able to function in its own building on Park Street in Calcutta. 

For a long time the East India Company was primarily concerned with 
the manufactures and the produce typically Indian. Nevertheless, when 
it consolidated its political position in the later half of the eighteenth 
century, the Company found it prudent to have a few scientific and technical 
establishments like the Survey Department and the Botanical Gardens as 
pointed out earlier. But it did not promote or organize studies of the 
natural history of India on scientific lines. However, the naturalist- 
members of the Asiatic Society were greatly interested in investigations of 
the rich and varied fauna and flora as well as geology and geography of 
India, and the Society encouraged such investigations. 


EDUCATION 

The East India Company for long was concerned mainly with its 
commercial interests and hence chose to be indifferent towards the promo- 
tion of education of the people of India as one of its distant objectives even. 



WESTERN SCIENCE IN INDIA 


497 


In the last two decades of the eighteenth century, however, some efforts 
were made for establishing a few educational institutions. Governor- 
General Warren Hastings founded in 1781 a Madrassa at Calcutta by 
providing a building for it at his own expense which was afterwards charged 
to the Company. The object of this institution was to promote the study 
of the Arabic and Persian languages and the Muhammadan Law, with a view, 
more especially, to the production of well-qualified officers for the Courts 
of Justice.® Nevertheless, in later years the curriculum underwent some 
change by including courses in natural philosophy, astronomy, geometry, 
arithmetic, logic and rhetoric. But it must be noted that the English 
language was not introduced as one of the subjects of study, nor was western 
learning taught there. In 1791 Jonathan Duncan, the Resident at Banares, 
opened the Hindu College with the object of educating the Hindus in their 
own language by prescribing courses in theology, medicine, music, 
mechanics, arts, grammar, mathematics, history, philosophy, law and 
literature. 

Of considerable historical significance from the point of view of the 
introduction of English education in India, is the active interest evinced by 
one of the Directors of the East India Company, Charles Grant who wrote 
a treatise (1792-97) entitled Observations on the State of Society among 
the Asiatic Subjects of Great Britain, Particularly with Respect to Morals; 
and on the Means of Improving It. Even though in this treatise Grant made 
some devastating remarks, many of them being in the nature of half-truths, 
he entered a vigorous plea to impart western education to the Indians in 
English, failing which in the Indian languages themselves. In his treatise 
he wrote: ‘Perhaps, no acquisition in natural philosophy would so effec- 
tively enlighten the mass of people, as the introduction of the principles 
of mechanics and their application to agriculture and the useful arts. Not 
that the Hindoos are wholly destitute of simple mechanical contrivances. 
Some manufactures, which depend upon patient attention and delicacy of 
hand, are carried to a considerable degree of perfection among them; but 
for a series of ages, perhaps for two thousand years, they do not appear 
to have made any considerable addition to the arts of life. Invention 
seems wholly trepid among them; in a few things they have improved by 
their intercourse with Europeans, of whose immense superiority they are 
at length convinced; but this effect is partial, and not discernible in the 
bulk of the people. The scope for improvement, in this respect, is prodi- 
gious.* Further, he advocated the improvement in agriculture by the 
introduction of mechanical contrivances.^ However, as it happened, the 
introduction as well as the growth of English education and, as part of it, 
the scientific and technical education could take roots in India only in the 
nineteenth century.

SCIENCE AND SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZATIONS IN 
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 

In the history of the people of India the importance of the nineteenth 
century which witnessed intellectual, economic and social development 
of a new order heralding the dawn of the modern outlook need hardly be 
overemphasized. It has been rightly said: ‘The nineteenth century was the 
great dividing line, and these hundred years changed the face of India far 
more than did the preceding thousand years.’® Evidently, the elements of 
the civilization of the West, the spirit of rationalism and the new awakening 
which burst forth in Europe then began to produce, albeit in a restricted 
way, a noticeable impact upon the minds of the Indians. Perhaps it is no 
exaggeration to say that one of the main causes for this development was 
the introduction of English education which, despite its outlandish in- 
congruity and being limited to certain sections of the people, contributed 
significantly to the transformation of India particularly in the later half of 
the nineteenth century. It may be noted that the first five universities were 
founded at Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Allahabad and Lahore, and a 
number of technical or professional schools and colleges established in 
different parts of the country during this period. Further, the provincial 
governments recognized the education of the people as one of their utmost 
responsibilities and constituted departments of public instruction for this 
purpose. 

The later half of the nineteenth century also saw the introduction of 
the telegraph and the railways. The first section of the telegraphic line 
was completed in February 1851 near Calcutta between Alipore and Raj- 
ghat, a distance of some 15 miles. The line was of iron rod in diameter 
weighing about 1,940 pounds per mile, in separate lengths of 13' 6", each 
welded together and with a protective coating of cloth and pitch so as to 
form a pliable envelope which would be impervious to water, saline, earth and 
eroding organisms.* This work was accomplished by W. B. O’Shaughnessy, 
a medical man who was then Professor of Chemistry in the Medical College at 
Calcutta and who later became the first Director of Telegraphs in India. He 
covered a further distance of 24 miles of telegraph line from Calcutta in the 
direction of Diamond Harbour by November 1857. It is interesting to 
note that in the same year Samuel Morse connected Washington with 
Baltimore, a distance of about 40 miles, with his device. An Indian by 
name Shib Chandra Nandy was associated with the work of O’Shaughnessy 
and was largely responsible for the laying of about 900 miles of telegraphic 
lines from Barakar to Allahabad, Banares to Mirzapur and onwards, and 
from Calcutta to Dacca. In the course of the next six years there were 
over 4,500 miles of telegraphic lines in India and some 46 receiving stations.*’

The first railway line was laid in 1853 between Bombay and Thana 
covering a distance of about 20 miles. In the next fifteen years the length 
covered by the railways rose to 1,088 miles, and by 1871 it was 5,077 miles. 
There was indeed a rapid advance in railway construction and by the end 
of the century, i.e. in the next span of about 30 years, 24,760 miles of rail- 
ways were laid,® connecting the important towns, harbours, and coal and 
other mineral-producing areas. In fact, the railway enterprise in India 
received from the government rather an extraordinary encouragement in 
preference to the construction of canals for irrigation purposes, as the 
former proved to be an effective carrier of goods of commercial importance 
in furtherance of the enlightened self-interest of the British. Whatever 
might have been the reason, the notable fact was that the railways created 
new types of employment, trade marts, new townships and introduced an 
element of mobility and intercourse among the different sections of the 
people, with obvious impact on certain social changes even. 

Apart from the telegraph and the railway, it may be noted that, as a 
result of the military and commercial motives on the one hand and adminis- 
trative exigencies which cropped up from time to time on the other, the 
government had to adopt concerted measures for making the then existing 
scientific service organizations more broad-based and utilitarian, as also 
establishing some new scientific institutions. Thus, among others, the 
meteorological, survey and botanical organizations developed all-India 
character; the geological survey came into being; and research institutes in 
engineering, bacteriology, medicine and agriculture were established. All 
these had impact, in their respective spheres, on the political and economic 
life of the nation. The network of scientific institutions of necessity spread 
over different parts of the country, and the gradual involvement of some 
of the local inhabitants in the scientific investigations, produced not un- 
noticeably a scientific climate in the country. Added to this, the learned 
societies took the lead not only in supporting a number of investigations 
but also publishing in their transactions and journals the important scientific 
findings of the investigators, some of whom travelled far and wide, on the 
plains and the hills, in pursuit of their researches. Though the people as 
a whole could not admittedly imbibe the true scientific spirit and were not 
educated enough to appreciate the importance of the scientific efforts, they 
could not but witness the growing influence of western science and its 
gradually taking roots in India. 

ROLE OF THE ASIATIC SOCIETY AND OTHER LEARNED BODIES 

Of the learned societies, the Asiatic Society continued to play a key 
role. As stated before, the Society moved to its own building in Park 
Street, Calcutta, in 1808. In the same year, Hare, a member of the Society, 
moved ‘that a Committee be appointed for the purpose of physical

investigations, the collection of facts, specimens, and correspondence with 
individuals whose situations in the country may be favourable for such 
discussions and investigations,’® and subsequently recommended the forma- 
tion of two Committees — one for ‘Natural History, Physics, Medicine, 
Improvement of the Arts, and whatever is comprehended in the general 
term of Physics’, and the other for Literature. From 1818 onwards the 
Physical Commitee did active work for several years. The biological as 
well as geological science also received necessary attention. The naturalist 
members of the Asiatic Society were greatly interested in scientific investi- 
gations of the rich and varied flora and fauna as well as geology and ge- 
ography of India. Among the earlier members of the Society were a number 
of mathematicians with the result the scientific contributions received in 
the beginning by the Society were concerned with some branch or other 
of mathematics.*^ As to the publications by the Society of research papers, 
the Asiatick Researches^ was divided into two parts in 1829 — one devoted 
wholly to scientific papers, and the other to literary communications. In 
1832, the Society started publishing the Journal of the Asiatic Society^ 
which, though in the beginning was devoted to the publication of papers 
of literary character, was an important periodical for scientific communi- 
cations. In a period of about fifty years over 500 papers in mathematical 
and physical sciences, 560 in zoology, 320 in geology and 80 in botany, 
besides some scientific notices, found place in this Journal. Besides the 
Asiatic Society, the Agricultural Society of India founded by William 
Carey in 1820 (renamed in 1826, the Agricultural and Horticultural Society 
of India) and the Bombay Natural History Society (1848) were among the 
other learned bodies which provided stimulus to scientific pursuits. 

It may, nevertheless, be emphasized that the founding of scientific 
organizations and learned societies was largely inspired by similar insti- 
tutions in Britain. No wonder that the organizational structure and even 
the aims and objective of some of them had their parallels in Britain. All 
the same, the men of science, though of European origin, who ushered in 
and nurtured these institutions spared no efforts in promoting them in the 
Indian context. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, the Indians 
who also began to work with them not only imbibed the spirit of free 
inquiry but also acquired experimental skills. Such an impact on the 
investigations undertaken by the Indians was discernible to a marked extent 
towards the closing of two decades of the century.

The publication ceased in 1839. 

In 1829 Captain J. D. Herbert, Deputy Surveyor-General, started a monthly under 
the name Gleanings in Science with a view to publishing extracts and abstracts from 
the European scientific publications. It used to publish also the Society’s monthly 
proceedings. On the initiative of James Prinsep, one of the Secretaries of the Asiatic 
Society, the periodical was taken over by the Society, and published under the name 
The Journal of the Asiatic Society, though the first number bore the title Journal of the 
Asiat ic Society of Bengal,

The researches conducted in India in the nineteenth century en- 
compassed different branches of science and received support from several 
scientific organizations. A significant feature was the use of instruments, 
some obtained from Britain and others designed and fabricated in the 
country itself. There were makers of scientific instruments at Calcutta, 
Bombay, Madras and Bangalore. A few of them were Indians, too, who 
soon learnt the instrumentation technique and were able to produce even 
some complicated instruments needed for survey work and engineering. 
Truly the modern science and technique made inroads into India in the 
nineteenth century. The following is in the nature of highlighting the 
major scientific organizations and researches, and the growth of scientific 
and technical education in India during this period. 


PHYSICAL SCIENCE INCLUDING METEOROLOGY, ASTRONOMY, SOLAR AND 
TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS 


Meteorology 

In the nineteenth century the meteorological and allied observations 
necessarily continued to make headway and became widespread in several 
parts of the country.®-^ At Calcutta, James Kyd prepared the register 
of tidal observations (1805-1828) relating to day and night tides in the 
river Hooghly at Kidderpore. G. T. Hardwicke maintained a meteorological 
register at Dum Dum from 1816 to 1823. In 1823 James Prinsep took a 
series of meteorological observations at Banaras for two years. In addi- 
tion, he studied the wet-bulb indications and contributed a paper on the 
depression of the wet-bulb hygrometer. He also analysed the daily range 
of the barometer in different parts of India. Major J. T. Boiieu prepared 
tables for determining the elastic force of aqueous vapour in the atmosphere 
as well as the dew-point temperature.^ In 1835, R. Everest published a 
paper on the revolution of the seasons, as also on the correspondence 
between the atmospheric phenomena and the changes of the moon.® He 
gave a detailed account of rain and drought of eight seasons in India from 
1831 to 1838. There were others like Cunningham, Richard Stratchey 
and Royle who meticulously recorded the meteorological data of their 
stations, some of which were at high altitudes. The diverse meteorological 
observations were also classified and studied from time to time, par- 
ticularly at the Surveyor-General’s office. It was in 1848 that the first 
attempt was made to record the maxima and minima temperatures, and in 
1856 hourly observations were started.-^ H. Piddington, who was the 
Curator of the Museum of Economic Geology and President of the Marine 
Court of Enquiry, compiled a series of 23 memoirs on the law of storms.

His account of the important cyclones® which occurred in the East from 
1829 to 1857 is well known. 

In the south, as early as 1836, the Rajah of Travancore founded at 
Trivandrum an observatory in which extensive observations were recorded 
by John Allan Broun, astronomer to the Rajah, from 1852 onwards. A 
branch of this observatory was also established in 1855 at Agastya-mula 
(a peak 6,200 ft. high), and the hourly observations made there yielded 
valuable data on atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity and evap- 
oration. Meteorological observations were also in progress by medical 
men and army officers at Bangalore, Mysore, Coorg, Doddabetta on the 
Nilgiri hills (8,640 ft, high) and Sikandarabad.*^ 

In the west, Benjamin, Norton and Colonel Sykes were the leading 
meteorologists. In particular, Sykes not only brought out the outstanding 
features of his barometrical indications relating to diurnal and nocturnal 
tides but also analysed systematically his hygrometric observations. He 
described the spectacular circular and white rainbows in the Deccan, the 
peculiarity of the winds, frequency of calms, quantity of electricity in the 
atmosphere and the peculiar atmospheric opacity in hot weather.^ The 
Bombay Observatory, established in 1823, made valuable contributions to 
meteorology from 1842 onwards, under George Buist, Orlebar, Montriou, 
Fergusson, Morland and Chambers. 

Though the meteorological stations in different parts of the country 
were actively engaged in the collection of valuable data, the need was felt 
for a general system of meteorological observations on a uniform plan. 
In 1863, Thomas Glaisher prepared a report pleading for such a recourse. 
Perhaps the year 1864 is of considerable significance in the history of meteo- 
rology in India; for in that year occurred a major cyclone which gripped 
Calcutta and the neighbourhood with devastating consequences — loss of 
over 80,000 human lives and huge damage to property on land, and ships 
on the sea. The Bengal Famine of 1866 was another natural calamity 
which further necessitated the development of meteorological observations. 

In 1865 a meteorological committee was appointed at Calcutta ‘to 
consider the best means of establishing a system of observations for the 
protection of that port’.** The committee recommended the appointment 
of observers, who were assistants in the Electric Telegraph Department, to 
record the data and transmit them by telegraph to the meteorological 
observatory attached to the Surveyor-General’s office at Calcutta. Soon 
meteorological reporters were appointed to the Governments of the Panjab 
(A. Neil) and the North-West Provinces (Murray Thomson). In 1867, 
H. F. Blanford, who was then Professor of Natural Sciences at the Presi- 
dency College at Calcutta and who was to play a great role in the evolution 
of the meteorological department, to be noticed later, was appointed as 
Meteorological Reporter to the Government of Bengal.

Though the work done by the different meteorological stations was 
indeed considerable and useful, the necessity arose for establishing ob- 
servatories in select parts of the country. Between 1865 and 1871, such 
observatories were established, and their work comprised collection as well 
as recording of the atmospheric data, issuance of cyclone warnings well in 
advance, tidal observations and astronomical and magnetic studies. The 
Aliporc Observatory at Calcutta was also determining correct time for the 
benefit of ships and telegraph offices by recording transit observations of 
stars. Of the important instruments in use then, mention may be made 
of Osier’s self-registering anemometer, different types of thermometers, 
Newman’s standard barometer, Regnault’s hygrometer, pluviometer, 
elcctroscopic apparatus and tide gauge. 

Blanforci and the Meteorological Department 

Organizationally the time had come to conceive of an all-India meteo- 
rological institution. In 1875, the India Meteorological Department was 
established with a view to consolidating the work of the provincial organiza- 
tions. The chief functions of the department included then, as now, 
experimental observations, preparation of daily weather charts, issuing 
weather summaries, seismological studies, solar physics and terrestrial 
magnetic studies. In 1875, Blanford was appointed as Meteorological 
Reporter to the Government of India. Under his able guidance the Mete- 
orological Department registered rapid progress, for Blanford not only 
reorganized the department but also sought to raise the number of obser- 
vatories so as to have an all-India coverage. He took concerted measures 
for improving upon the quality of observations leading to effective co- 
ordination of the data collected. By 1878 there were as many as 103 
observatories at work, and in 1885 their number rose to 128, exclusive of 
22 observatories in Bengal, which were established in connection with the 
provincial system of collecting telegraphic weather reports.® 

Realizing the importance of collecting data concerning the forest 
weather, Blanford established in 1885 an observatory at the Forest School 
at Dehra Dun, which also served as a training institution.'^ To Blanford, 
therefore, belongs the credit of being practically the founder of systematic 
and uniform meteorological observations through the length and breadth 
of India.'^ 

Blanford himself was a great experimentalist and a meticulous com- 
piler of the observed data. He showed that the variations in solar heat, 
being considerable, would exert an influence on all the terrestrial pheno- 
mena, and stressed the need for direct actinometric observations as the only 
means of ascertaining the heat-variation.^* He made observations on the 
irregularities of atmospheric pressure in the Indian monsoon region. In 
addition, he worked on the variations in the barometric tides with reference

to diurnal land and sea breezes. He also prepared a catalogue of the 
recorded cyclones in the Bay of Bengal up to the end of 1876. With John 
Eliot, Blanford made significant contributions relating to rainfall, tor- 
nadoes, hygrometer and the like.

Meteorological Centre, Nagpur, Silver Jubilee Souvenir, Appendix III.) 


In 1878, Eliot introduced a system of daily reports on the weather in 
all parts of India.® He even devised a system of issuing storm signals for 
the port. It would appear that before 1884 all the officers of the India 
Meteorological Department were Europeans. In 1884, however, the 
department took a decision to train an educated Indian, as an experimental 
measure, in meteorology, particularly in the preparation of daily weather 
reports. This honour fell on Lala Ruchi Ram Sahni of the Panjab, who, 
after his B.A. degree in physical science, was then qualifying for M.A. 
degree.** In 1889, Eliot succeeded Blanford as the Meteorological Reporter 
to the Government of India.

Astronomical Investigations 

In respect of astronomical investigations, there were some individual 
attempts to observe the transit of planets like Mercury and Venus. James 
Prinsep observed the transit of Mercury on the 5th of May 1832 using a 
four-foot achromatic telescope of four inches aperture, mounted equatorially 
and provided with a delicate micrometer.® Colonel Tennant made obser- 
vations on the transit of Venus, and its egress from the sun, on the 9th 
of December 1874 at Roorkee.^ These individual efforts amply illustrate 
the versatility of the persons concerned, and their abiding interest in 
matters celestial. 

At the Madras Observatory important astronomical work was in 
progress, a summary of which can be found in Markham’s book. Briefly 
stated, John Goldingham and his deputy Warren, both trained astronomers, 
were engaged in many an astronomical observation. In their work they 
were ably helped by two Indian assistants who made regular astronomical 
observations relating to the sun’s transit every day at noon, the eclipse of 
the Jupiter’s satellites occurring almost every night, and the transits of a 
number of recognized stars, with a view to regulating the astronomical 
clock. Thomas Glanville Taylor, who succeeded Goldingham, equipped 
the observatory with new and more powerful instruments including transit 
instruments, astronomical clocks, telescopes and circular measurer.^ He 
began the compilation of the Star Catalogue which was published in 1844 in 
its final form containing the places of some 11,000 stars.^^ 

N. R. Pogson, who was associated with this observatory for a period 
of thirty years (1861-1891), equipped it with precision instruments, the 
principal among them were a transit circle and an 8J-inch equatorial. 
The former was employed for the preparation of a catalogue of 5,000 stars. 
With the latter Pogson discovered six minor planets and seven variable 
stars. The minor planets, noticed between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, 
were Asia (17 April 1861), Freia (2 February 1864), Sappho (3 May 1864), 
Sylvia (16 May 1866), Camilla (17 November 1868) and Vera (6 February 
1885).® It was Pogson who thought of establishing a branch of this ob- 
servatory in the Palni or Nilgiri hills, particularly for the photographic and 
spectroscopic observations of the sun and the stars. But no action ensued 
in his lifetime. The Madras Famine of 1876-1877 which occurred due to 
the failure of the moonsoon rains gave a fillip to the establishment of a 
solar physics observatory, inasmuch as the Commission of Inquiry which 
was appointed by the government to investigate the cause of the famine, 
brought to the notice of the government ‘a correlation between the seasonal 
distribution of rain in India and sunspot periodicity and hence recommended

that necessary steps be taken for solar observations’.® When C. Michie 
Smith was appointed as Government Astronomer to succeed Pogson in 
1891, the project began to take some shape. In 1895, Michie Smith selected 
Kodaikanal in the upper Palni hills as the location for establishing a solar 
physics observatory. The construction work was taken up in 1899 and in 
the same year the administrative control of this observatory was transferred 
to the India Meteorological Department. The Solar Physics Observatory 
started functioning in 1900. Sunspot spectra, hydrogen content of solar 
prominences, spectrum of the night sky, variation in the area of hydro- 
gen absorption, and meteorological and seismological studies were among 
the important investigations undertaken in this observatory. 

Geomagnetic Studies 

In respect of geomagnetic studies, as early as 1834 India participated 
in the global study of the earth’s magnetism, which was organized by the 
Gottingen Magnetic Union with a view to recording simultaneous magnetic 
observations at 50 stations during 1834-1841.* Out of the six stations in 
the whole of Asia selected for this purpose, there were three in 
India— at Madras, Simla and Trivandrum. Later in 1840, a magnetic 
observatory was started at Colaba (Bombay) through a fortunate accident. 
In that year, a magnetic observatory was proposed to be started at Aden 
and as for some reasons it was not materializing then, the instruments were 
diverted to Colaba where a meteorological and time determination ob- 
servatory had already been at work since 1823. The magnetic observatory 
was shifted from Colaba to Alibag (18 miles south-east of Bombay) in 
1904, in view of the introduction of the electric traction for the street tram 
service then, lest the electric current should vitiate the magnetic observations. 
The Alibag Observatory is regarded as one of the primary magnetic ob- 
servatories of the world. 

Isostasy 

In the field of geophysics, the officers of the Trigonometric Survey of 
India continued to provide the lead. In 1864, the Surveyor-General 
Walker applied to the Secretary of State for India, seeking permission to 
undertake a series of pendulum experiments in connection with the trigo- 
nometrical survey. The proposal found the support of most of the eminent 
Fellows of the Royal Society which, for this purpose, even lent an astro- 
nomical clock and two invariable pendulums which were supplemented by a 
copper vacuum cylinder and an air pump. Captain J. P. Basevi,'^ who 
was entrusted with this task, did experiments at nineteen stations of the 
Indian Arc from Dehra Dun to Cape Comorin, in addition to two stations

on the east coast, and two on the west coast as also in the Minicoy Island. 
The Imperial Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburg lent two convertible 
pendulums (which were already used on the Russian Arc) with a view to 
establishing a connection between the Indian and the Russian experiments. 
These investigations led to the important discovery of isostasy, i.e. a condi- 
tion supposed to exist in the earth’s crust, whereby equal earth masses under- 
lie equal areas down to an assumed level of compensation. These were 
interpreted mathematically by A. Pratt, as a result of which the theory of 
isostatic compensation emerged." 

Other Physical Investigations 

O’Shaughnessy who, as stated before, was the first to conceive of 
and lay the telegraphic line, contributed several memoranda based on his 
electric experiments relating to the communication of telegraphic signals by 
induced electricity.'^ Schwendler, who held the post of Superintendent 
Electrician of Government Telegraphs in India, conducted experiments on 
the use of platinum for the emission of brilliant light when a sufficiently 
strong electric current was passed through it. He also investigated the 
proper method of supplying signalling currents.^ Major Waterhouse of 
the Survey of India examined the influence of the newly discovered dye 
called cosin, on the photographic action of the solar spectrum upon the 
bromide and bromide-iodide of silver. Another work for which he is 
well known related to the photographs of the solar disc which he took in 
connection with the transit of Venus in December 1874.‘* 


SURVEY OF INDIA 

In the nineteenth century the survey work assumed a new dimension 
and was carried out in a truly scientific manner using a number of instru- 
ments which included the theodolite, chronometer, telescope, prismatic 
compass, perambulators, planetables and sextants. The surveyors were 
able and devoted men among whom the names of William Lambton and 
George Everest stand out prominently. 

William Lambton 

In the history of the Survey of India the name of William Lambton 
(1753-1823) has particularly a distinct place. For it was Lambton who 
initiated a progressive survey of the whole country and ushered in the 
Great Trigonometrical Survey of India. In brief, the trigonometrical 
surveying is divided into three distinct branches.® Firstly, some sites are 
selected for measuring base lines so as to form the ends of certain ranges

of triangles which are then measured as accurately as possible. The base 
of the triangle is computed, and by trigonometrical methods, the distances 
of other points visible from its extremities are ascertained through angular 
observations with the help of suitable instruments. Secondly, the desired 
range of triangles is constructed by determining the positions of selected 
points on the earth’s surface by the angles taken from the ends of the 
measured base line, and then carried on from point to point in succession 
so as to form a network of positions along a belt of the country. Then 
the primary triangulation is completed by a specific number of such belts 
across the desired area of survey in the directions of both latitude and 
longitude. Thirdly, the triangulation so done is checked by aslrononfical 
observations of latitude and longitude at selected points. 

Lambton was well versed in trigonometrical computations, geography 
and geodesy. The experience of his military service convinced him of the 
need of employing the geodetic methods which would help determine the 
size and figure of the earth’s surface through determinations of triangulation, 
altitude, longitude and gravity. Lambton’s efforts for a scientific mapping 
of India using the geodetic science received great support and warm appreci- 
ation from the govermnent. Encouraged by this, he had already proposed 
in the closing year of the eighteenth century, a mathematical and geographi- 
cal survey across the peninsula from coast to coast, which ‘ was to serve as 
a foundation for a general survey of the whole country, being controlled 
by astronomical observations and carried out on scientific principles, and 
was to be capable of extension in any direction and to any distance.’®’ ^ 

In 1800, an independent trigonometrical survey was organized in 
Madras. Lambton commenced his task in Mysore area, measured a base 
line near Bangalore, and in the next eighteen months carried out a pre- 
liminary triangulation of Mysore. In his earlier attempts Lambton used a 
chain of blistered steel consisting of forty links of two and a half feet each 
with a total measurement of 100 feet. He had also in his possession one 
three-foot theodolite, one circular instrument, one zenith sector, a small 
transit telescope, two steel chains, six thermometers, one astronomical 
telescope and two small chronometers, with which he carried out his sub- 
sequent work. As the first operation of his general trigonometrical survey, 
he measured a base line near St, Thomas Mount at Madras for his triangles 
north and south through the Carnatic. He then completed a meridional 
arc from Cuddalore to Madras and by observations of latitude at both 
ends he was able to attain a value of the degree for his work. By 1815 he 
had compiled a general map of the southern region. Further, he deter- 
mined the largest arc ever measured in any other country, having an ampli- 
tude of 9® 53' 45^^ and so close to the equator.® Lambton’s efforts resulted 
not only in covering the entire peninsula as high as 15" N. lat. with a net- 
work of triangles, braced by main cross belts and but also in fixing the 
geographical position of a number of prominent points. His results

A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


were published ‘with such explanations and discussions that proclaimed to 
the whole scientific world that a survey was proceeding in India that would 
yield geodetic results of the very highest importance to science.’® 

Lambton’s systematic work earned him a permanent place in the 
field of geodetic measurements. As General Walker said of him later 
(1870): ‘Of all Colonel Lambton’s contributions to geodesy, the most 
important are his measurements of meridional arcs, the results of which 
have been employed up to the present time, in combination with those of 
other parts of the globe, in all investigations of the figure of the earth.’ 
What is more, Lambton produced a profound impact upon his flagmen who 
were Indians. In the words of Everest who collaborated with him: ‘I 
learnt how to value the natives of southern India, who, knowing no master 
but Lieutenant-Colonel Lambton, unconnected with and unknown by the 
government they served, without provision for themselves in case of their 
being crippled by sickness, accident or age, or for their families in the event 
of their death, yet ventured fearlessly and without a murmur to face those 
awful dangers which would have made the stoutest hearts quirl and shrink.’^ 
Such then was Lambton whose qualities of head and heart were a great 
source of inspiration to his followers. As to Lambton himself, he wrote 
in one of his reports thus: ‘In 20 years devoted to this work I have scarcely 
experienced a heavy hour. Such is the case when the human mind is ab- 
sorbed in pursuits that call its powers into action. A man so engaged, 
his time passes on insensibly, and if his efforts are successful his reward is 
great, and a retrospect of his labours will afford him an endless satisfaction. 
If such should be my lot 1 shall close my career with heartfelt satisfaction, 
and look back with unceasing delight on the years I have passed in India.’*^ 
Lambton had two technical assistants, Henry Voysey as surgeon 
and geologist of whom we shall speak later, and George Everest as surveyor. 
Soon he extended his great work and carried his central arc northwards 
into Berar before he breathed his last on his way to Nagpur in 1823. 
His work was continued with equal precision by Everest in Upper India. 
There is no denying that both Lambton and Everest contributed a great 
deal to the geodetic mapping of India on scientific lines. 


Mackenzie and others 

In 1815, Mackenzie‘S was named the Surveyor-General of India with 
the object of controlling the surveys of the three Presidencies, but he did 
not have any authority over the survey work in progress under Lambton. 
In 1818, however, Lambton’s work, which by then had reached beyond 
the limits of the Madras Presidency, came under the over-all control of 
the government under the name ‘The Great Trigonometrical Survey of 
India*.

Even though appointed as the Surveyor-General of India, Mackenzie 
chose to remain in the Madras Presidency for two years, reorganized the 
department effectively and, on his own part, started the survey of the then 
Northern Circars with the help of his assistants, William Scott, Henry 
Hamilton and Marccllus Burke. This survey, later designated as the 
‘Rajamundry Survey’, was completed in 1824 with full details by using plain- 
table, angular instruments and field-books. 

In 1822, it was decided to prepare an atlas of India so as to depict the 
whole country on the quarter-inch scale, and for this purpose selections 
were made from the different surveys and suitably reduced. These consti- 
tuted the standard map of India for the next eighty years. 

The survey of the Himalayas was also taken up in right earnest by 
John Anthony Hodgson who is well known for his survey of Sirmur and 
Garhwal (1816-1818), making the Chaur peak as his principal station of 
observation. Early in 1817, William Spencer Webb started an independent 
survey of the Kumaon hills and completed his work in 1821. The survey 
up the river Brahmaputra was also undertaken at this time. Hodgson 
became the Surveyor-General of India (1821) and initiated revenue survey 
of Upper Provinces one by one. He even held charge as Revenue Surveyor- 
General from 1823 to 1826. Valentine Blacker who produced important 
maps of Central India was Surveyor-General from 1823 to 1826. 

In the Bombay region, while James Southerland look up a regular 
survey of the Deccan (1810), Thomas Jervis started an independent survey 
of the southern Konkan, though both these surveys seemed to lack the 
desired accuracy. 

George Everest 

Special mention has been made already of George Everest who made 
conspicuous contributions to the Survey of India. In 1824, he continued 
the Great Arc of triangulation across the Narmada to Sirnoj (on parallel 
24°). But on account of ill health he returned to England, and six years 
later was again in India with the most up-to-date instruments that he could 
obtain in Great Britain to carry on the trigonometrical survey. His new 
instruments included compensation bars (instead of the chains), a large 
theodolite with an azimuth circle of 36" diameter, two double vertical 
circles (three feet in diameter; for astronomical observations), heliotropes 
and reverberatory lamps. 

In October 1830, Everest was appointed as the Surveyor-General of 
India as well as Superintendent of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, and 
he occupied this high office for about 13 years. It may be said with- 
out exaggeration that this period was by far the most important in the 
progress of geodetic work in India, and the man solely responsible, not only 
for the organization of the survey work but also for the achievements of 
high order, was undoubtedly Everest. With great ability and imagination, 
he evolved a working plan for the trigonometric survey, recruited and 



512

trained the staff for his purpose and, more importantly, secured in an 
abundant measure the goodwill and support of the government at home 
and the Court of Directors in England. In his arduous task, he was ably 
assisted by Andrew Scott Waugh, a surveyor of the highest calibre, who 
befittingly succeeded him as Surveyor-General in 1843. Of the other loyal 
assistants, Renny, Wilcox, Boileu, Logan, Oliver, Murphy, Armstrong and 
James proved eminently fit for field-work. As to the instruments, he 
had already in his possession, as stated above, the most accurate and useful 
ones. Imaginative as he doubtless was, he managed to get one Henry 
Barrow, a skilled mechanic, from London as mathematical instrument 
maker. Even so he had already observed an Indian, Mohsin Husain of 
Arcot in south India, who proved his mettle in mechamcal repairs and 
adjustments, and reconstruction of old instruments. Husain even accom- 
panied Everest in some of the surveys and impressed him as a remarkable 
mechanic with inventive talents. Of him Everest said: ‘He has both genius 
and originality; his conduct is marked by the highest probity, and he is one 
of the few on whose word 1 could place entire reliance.’^* When Barrow 
gave up the job and left for home, Everest appointed Husain as the mathe- 
matical instrument maker at Calcutta. For his ingenuity, Husain was 
granted a personal allowance of Rs.150 per month even after Everest left. 

For his projected work, Everest organized two field and six subordinate 
meridional series, and kept one field party under his own charge. Between 
1832 and 1841, all the field-work of Everest’s two sections of the Great 
Arc from Bidar in the then Nizam’s territories to Banog in the Himalayas — 
a direct distance of about 870 miles, from the latitude 17° 55' to 30° 29'— 
was completed. As regards the six subordinate meridional series, he was 
able to complete three of them, viz. Budaon, Rangheer and Amua (central 
India, near Sagar), whilst the other three, viz. Karara, Chindwar and Gora, 
were in progress. 

Andrew Waugh 

Andrew Waugh, who was born in Cannanore (Kerala) and who later 
worked intimately with Everest, took up the triangulation of the region 
between the Great Arc series and Calcutta, and completed it with great 
accuracy. He then proceeded with the north-eastern Himalayan series in 
1845 and brought it to a successful conclusion in 1850. It is interesting to 
note that this was the largest series in the world at that time, being some 
1,690 miles long from the Dehra Dun base to that of Somakhoda, in the 
Purnea district of Bengal. While the main chain of this series was in 
progress, the heights of the major Himalayan peaks were fixed using a 
theodolite. Of the 79 peaks so determined, the highest called the 15th 
peak, which was 29,002 feet above sea-level, was named as Mount 
Everest by Waugh, in honour of George Everest.^

During Waugh’s time, attention was also paid to the formation of a 
gridiron of triangulation to the westward of the Great Arc series in the 
Panjab and Sind. This work which was commenced in 1847 was nearing 
completion when Waugh retired in 1861. About this time (1855), the 
work on the Kashmir series was also in progress under the direction of 
Captain Montgomerie. On the retirement of Waugh, the government 
bifurcated the offices of the Superintendent of the Great Trigonometrical 
Survey and the Suveryor-General, and appointed Colonel Walker to the 
first, and Colonel Thuillier to the second. Walker continued the work on the 
Great North-Western Gridiron and remeasured some of the Great Arc series. 

Radhamth Sikdar 

The notable Indian who did remarkable work in the Great Trigono- 
metrical Survey of India was one by name Radhanath Sikdar (1813- 
1870). A distinguished student of the Hindu College (Calcutta), Radhanath 
joined the Trigonometrical Survey in 1831 and made a name for himself 
in the survey work and the associated mathematical applications. He ac- 
companied Everest, Waugh and Renny in their work concerning the Great 
Arc, and was found to be the ablest of the eight of the native computers 
then working. He proved his acumen by preparing the Auxi Tables. 
George Everest said of him thus: . a hardy, energetic young man who 
received an exceedingly good education in mathematics at the Hindoo 
College ... Of the quaUfications of Radhanath I cannot speak too highly; 
in his mathematical attainments there are few in India— European or native— 
that can at all compete with him; and it is my impression that even in 
Europe these attainments would rank very high. As a computer he is 
quite indefatigable and there is no person in my department so thoroughly 
skilful in the application of the various formulae . . . Eventually he will 
furnish a convincing proof that the aptitude of your countrymen for the 
practical, as well as the theoretical parts of mathematics, is no wise inferior 
to that of Europeans.*® In 1864, Radhanath was elected a Corresponding 
Member of the Society of Natural History (Bavaria) — a rare distinction 
conferred by a reputed German Philosophical Society on a foreigner. He 
was for several years on the Physical Science Committee of the Asiatic 
Society, and compiled the meteorological observations (1853-1864) which 
appeared in the Society’s Journal. 

BOTANICAL INVESTIGATIONS 


Roxburgh 

In the nineteenth centuiy, the botanical investigations took rapid 
strides and the efforts made earlier towards cultivation of the commercially 
important exotic plants met with considerable success. Roxburgh set an

515 


example for those who collaborated with or followed him by his zeal and 
devotion to the study of plants as well as cataloguing them scientifically. 
The Indian Linnaeus, as Roxburgh became known later, systematically 
formulated and gave a scientific shape to the Garden. Under his care 
and influence, the Garden, in addition to its being a viable ground for 
promoting plants of commercial interest, became an active centre of botani- 
cal investigations. In this respect, he appeared to have drawn inspiration 
from the earlier work of Koenig. Roxburgh drew up a catalogue of about 
3,500 species growing in the Garden, and employing local artists, prepared 
illustrations of a number of plants. His work was published in two parts 
in 1814 under the name Hortus Bengalensis by his trusted friend William 
Carey (1761-1834), who himself had developed an admirable Botanical 
Garden at Serampore near Calcutta. Roxburgh also compiled vast informa- 
tion for his important publications, viz. Flora Indica (excluding that of 
the Himalayas; published posthumously in 3 vols; 1820, 1824 and 1832 
under Carey’s editing) and Plantae Coromandelianae (in 3 vols; 1795, 1802 
and 1819). His labour did not end with them. He produced over 2,300 
coloured illustrations in 35 volumes depicting various plants. In fact 
these illustrations were found very useful by the famous botanist of the 
Kew Garden, Joseph Dalton Hooker (1817-1911), when he planned his 
Flora of British India, For his systematic and untiring botanical work, 
Roxburgh has been rightly reckoned as the ^Father of Indian Botany’. 
In the words of George King who worked about fifty years later at the 
Garden: ‘Roxburgh was the first botanist who attempted to draw up a 
systematic account of the plants of India and his book, which is on the 
Linnaean System, is the basis of all subsequent works on Indian botany, 
and until the publication of Sir Joseph Hooker’s monumental work, it 
remained the only single book through which a knowledge of Indian plants 
could be acquired.’® Roxburgh was succeeded by Buchanan Hamilton 
(1762-1829) who was a zoologist as well as a botanist. He had already 
explored the Mysore and Bengal areas and produced a commentary on van 
Rheede’s Hortus Malabaricus. He sent about 1,500 specimens and 400 
drawings to his friends in Europe. 

Nathaniel Wallich and William Carey 

The Dane Nathaniel Wallich (1786-1854), who was Professor at the 
Medical College, Calcutta, succeeded Buchanan Hamilton in 1815 as the 
Superintendent of the Botanic Garden. He came to India as a surgeon 
in the Danish settlement of Serampore. That was the time when Britain 
and Denmark were at war as a consequence of which, in India, Serampore 
was annexed by the Britishers, and Wallich was among the prisoners held 
by them. However, the East India Company did not lose much time in 
making use of his acumen and permitting him to undertake botanical 
exploration. Wallich, too, displayed great enthusiasm, undaunted by the

donated the major part of his collection to the Linnaean Society (founded

in England in 1720). The European botanists of his time looked upon 
these collections as a veritable mine of information for their own researches. 
Wallich is remembered for his work, Plantae Asiaticae Rariores (3 volumes; 
300 coloured plates; published in 1832 by the East India Company) and 
Tentamen Florae Nepalensis, He collaborated with William Carey in the later 
publications of Roxburgh.

A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


William Carey, as already mentioned, took a leading part in the found- 
ing in 1820 of the Agricultural Society of India. Carey was a remarkable 
investigator and, as noted already, had developed a botanic garden includ- 
ing a herbarium on his own at Serampore, and spared no efforts for the 
successful propagation of certain imported seeds and plants on the Indian 
soil. After Carey’s death, his herbarium was donated to the University of 
Copenhagen, and the duplicates to William Hooker in England. In 1842 
Voigt, his disciple, brought out a united catalogue of the plants grown in the 
Botanic Gardens at Serampore and Sibpur under the title Hortus Suburbams 
Calcuttensis. 

Other Investigators 

In the south, Robert Wight (1796-1872), who was working at Samul- 
cottah, went about in a systematic manner and collected a number of plant 
specimens, some of which were sent to Robert Graham at Edinburgh and 
William Hooker at Glasgow. He brought out jointly with Walter Arnott 
the publication entitled Prodromus Florae Peninsulae Indiae Orientalis (1834). 
Griffith was another collector who gathered as many as 9,000 species in the 
thirteen years of his stay in India at this time. 

Complementary to the Botanic Garden at Calcutta was one at Saharan- 
pur. George Govan, John Forbes Royle and Thomson worked there, and 
threw light on the botany and other branches of the natural history of the 
Himalayan mountains. Hugh Falconer who was at this garden and later 
at Calcutta brought to light the fossil flora of India. 

Thomas Thomson conducted botanical investigations in the northern 
plains, the Himalayas as well as Kashmir. He collaborated with John 
Dalton Hooker (son of William Hooker) in the publication of the first 
volume of Flora Indica (1855). Their combined collections were astonish- 
ingly of the order of 150,000 specimens (about 9,500 species). Thomas 
Anderson (1832-1872) succeeded Thomas Thomson at the Botanic Garden. 
Charles Baron Clarke (1832-1908), who was also associated with the Garden, 
though a mathematician by training, took great interest in the flora of 
India and tried to categorize them ‘areawise’ (phytogeographically). He 
is well known for his monograph on the ferns of northern India. 

The Herbarium 

The Garden with its 15,000 trees and shrubs including a 200-year-old 
great banyan tree (about 950 roots; circumference 1328 ft.) and a number 
of astounding herbaceous species is a living storehouse of botanical knowl- 
edge. Its Herbarium is a house of almost all the dried plant materials of 
the whole of the Indian subcontinent, Asia, Europe and Australia. 
Nathaniel Wallich, as stated before, distributed its rich botanical collections 
to the principal institutions and botanists of Europe. The present collec- 
tions date from 1832. George King says in the Centenary Report of the 
Botanic Garden: ‘. . . It (the Herbarium) consists of plants contributed by 



WESTERN SCIENCE IN INDIA 


519 


almost every worker of botany in India since that date, and of considerable 
contribution from botanists in Europe. It is first and foremost an Indian 
Herbarium, but the plants of South-Eastern Asia, of Japan, of Persia and 
of Asia Minor are fairly well represented. Those of Europe are also ex- 
cellently represented; but in African and American plants the collection is 
comparatively poor. Constant communication and interchange of speci- 
mens have been kept up for the last fifty years with the great nation collec- 
tion at Kew, and to the distinguished Directors of that institution, Sir 
William Hooker and his son and successor Sir Joseph, the Calcutta Her- 
barium is indebted for valuable contributions. Interchanges have also 
been kept up with other European botanic institutions, such as the Her- 
barium of the British Museum, of the Jardin des Plants, Paris, the Imperial 
Gardens at St. Petersburgh and Berlin, the Royal Botanical Gardens at 
Buitenzorg in Java, at Peradeniya in Ceylon, and at Saharanpur; and many 
other institutions.’ The Herbarium, the first in India and recognized as 
one of the most important herbaria in Asia, has indeed vast collections 
numbering over two millions of specimens. Housed earlier in the Superin- 
tendent’s bungalow, they are now meticulously preserved in the building 
which became available in 1883 and 1884. 

George King 

The Garden suffered extensive damage from two terrible cyclones which 
occurred in 1864 and 1867. As a result of the cyclone of 1864, it was 
submerged in six to seven feet deep water, and the saline tidal effect pro- 
duced a distressing spectacle. In 1871, the Garden was renovated and re- 
organized under the direction of its new and energetic Superintendent 
George King, who also worked out its phytographical arrangement. 

Qualified in medicine in the University of Aberdeen, King came to 
India as Superintendent at the Saharanpur Garden (1869), was Assistant 
Forest Conservator at Dehra Dun (1869-1870) and a year later was trans- 
ferred to Calcutta to work at the Botanic Garden. He was also appointed 
as Professor of Botany at the Medical College, Calcutta. The present 
Botanical Survey of India was established in 1890 mainly as a result of 
the persuasive efforts of King who became the first ex-officio Director of 
the Survey. He collected valuable materials relating to the flora of the 
Malay Peninsula. In 1887 he started the publication of the Annals of 
the Royal Botanic Garden. His meritorious service resulted in his becoming 
later the Director of the Royal Botanic Garden at Kew (1897). 

David Prain 

After the retirement of George King, David Prain who was then the 
Curator of the Herbarium became the Director of the Botanical Survey. 
He undertook a number of taxonomic studies relating to Papaveraceae, 
Leguminosae, Scrophulariaceae and the like, and brought out a series under 



520 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


the title Noviciae Indica (1889-1898). Later he published a book under 
the title Bengal Plants. 

The Botanical Survey of India 

The object of the Botanical Survey of India was not only to inten- 
sify the botanical exploration of the country particularly of the western 
Himalayan region but also to co-ordinate the scientific activities of the 
provincial botanical departments in Bombay, North-West Frontier Provinces, 
Madras and Bengal. Theodore Cooke, who was then the Principal of 
Science College, Poona, was the Director for Bombay region, J. F. Duthie 
was for north-western India at Saharanpur, and M. A. Lawson was for 
the southern region at Madras. They had undertaken a number of impor- 
tant botanical investigations. As a result, valuable publications like Flora 
of the Bombay Presidency (Theodore Cooke, 2 vols; 1901-1908), Bengal 
Plants (Prain 1903) and Flora of Upper Gangetic Plain (Duthie) were brought 
out, while the Flora of Madras appeared later. The scientific investigations 
of the Botanical Survey of India have been largely responsible for the growth 
in the Indian soil of several exotic plants of commercial importance such 
as cinchona, rubber, tea, potatoes, coffee, certain fibrous plants, spices, and 
tobacco. 


GEOLOGICAL EXPLORATIONS 

EARLY INVESTIGATIONS 

In the early decades of the nineteenth century, some of the versatile 
European naturalists, medical men and engineers were, in addition to their 
own fields of employment, actively engaged in geological investigations in 
the Deccan, central and north India, and the Himalayas. In 1820 H. W. 
Voysey, who as a surgeon was associated with the work of Lambton in the 
latter’s survey work, published an account of the diamond mines of south 
India.® He also prepared a geological sketch of the ‘ Nalla Mala M ountains *, 
north of the river Krishna, and suggested the name of ‘ Clay Slate Formation’ 
to the rocks of which the mountains are composed. In 1835 P. M. Benza, 
who was surgeon to the Governor of Madras, examined the geology of the 
Nilgiris and noticed the basaltic dykes. He described specially the several 
varieties of iron ores occurring in the region, as also the highly fossiliferous 
intcrtrappean limestone with oyster and other shales at Rajamundry.*’ 
Another medical man, T. G. Malcalmson, studied the formation of the 
Deccan Trap, and also gave an account of the Lonar Lake as being in the 
form of a ‘vast crater nearly 500 feet deep, and four or five miles round on 
the upper margin, the water being green and bitter, supersaturated with 
alkaline carbonate, and containing sUex in solution, as well as some iron*.® 
Captain *1. T. Newbold studied systematically the geology of southern 


• Voysey. p. 120. » Bose (P. N.) (1), pp. 29-30. Malcalmson (2). p. 302.

India, particularly between Bellary and Bijapur between the years 1836 and 
1847. He observed the chloritic band as well as the clay iron beds at some 
places, and threw light on the origin and age of kankar, regur and laterite. 
It was Newbold who first detected the occurrence of veins of manganese in 
the laterite. His classification of the rocks of the south Maharashtra 
region is well known.® 

In central India, Captain James Franklin sought to describe the forma- 
tion of the Vindhyan. In 1833 R. Everest examined the sandstone and 
trap formation in the west of Mirzapur,*' while J. Finnis investigated the 
lithology of the rocks found between Nagpur and Hoshangabad in 1834.*^ 
During 1848-1852 Captain W. S. Sherwill of the Revenue Survey was the first 
to examine the structure of the Rajmahal hills.** He also discovered the coal 
of the Chuparbhita Pass. About this time, J. Homfrey’s first published 
account on the Raniganj coalfields as contained in his descriptions of the 
Daraodar Valley also appeared.*' 

As to the geology of the Himalayas, Captain J. D. Herbert’s is a judi- 
cious and scientific account which describes the rocks and other forma- 
tions of the mountains as well as the minerals found in the region.-^ In 
1831 H. Falconer explored the Siwalik hills and inferred the Tertiary Age 
of this formation, comparing it with the Molasse Horizon of Switzerland. 


PALAEONTOLOGY 

The most outstanding work of Falconer was on the fossil bones of the 
Siwalik region, in association with Proby Cautley (the foremost engineer at 
that time in charge of the Jamuna Canal Project), which has earned for 
the former a great name as a palaeontologist. Falconer, Cautley and two 
other engineers, William Baker and Henry Durand, brought to light the 
remarkable fossil fauna of the Sub-Himalayan Range.^' * The sketches in 
Fig. 10.6 represent the four fossils of Mastodon perimensis Falc. and Caut., 
Sivatherium giganteum Falc. and Caut., Mastodon sivalensis Falc. and Caut. 
and Equus sivalensis Falc. and Caut., discovered by Falconer and Cautley in 
the Siwalik hills, the originals of which have been preserved in the British 
Museum of Natural History and reproduced from the cast collections of the 
Geological Survey of India, preserved in the Indian Museum, Calcutta. 
‘Unequalled for richness and extent in any other region then known, the 
fossils created no little sensation throughout the scientific world. The 
Wollaston Medal in duplicate was awarded in 1837 to both Falconer and 
Cautley by the Geological Society of London ; and the learned societies of 
Europe and America hastened to mark their appreciation by the bestowal of 
appropriate honours. Sir Charles LyeU announced the award of the

Geological Society of London in terms which must have been no mean 
incentive to young Falconer for he was at that time under thirty.’® The 
Memoirs by Falconer and Cautley on the Sivatherium giganteum, Felix 
cristata and Ursa sivalensis, and on fossil species of the camel and hippo- 
potamus were published in the Asiatic Researches. Apart from these, 
Falconer completed in 1855 a descriptive catalogue of the vertebrate fossils of 
the Siwalik hills, the Narmada, Perim Island, etc., which were preserved in 
the Museum of the Asiatic Society. When he died, a committee consisting 
of the presidents of the Royal, Linnaean, Geological, Geographical, and 
Ethnological Societies of England raised a ‘Falconer Memorial Fund’, and 
installed his marble bust in the Royal Society. Falconer’s Fauna Antigua 
Sivalensis was edited and published by Murchison in 1865 posthumously. 

Of the other early important geological investigations, special mention 
may be made of the work done by A. Fleming of the Bengal Medical Service 
on the Salt Range of the Panjab during 1848-1853. He described the 
height and course of the Salt Range as also its physical features and strati- 
graphy.* Another investigation was by Captain Hannay who studied 
meticulously the earthquakes in Assam for about four years (1839-1843),^ 
Colonel Baird Smith of the Bengal Engineers also recorded and analysed 
the nature of Indian earthquakes, and even made observations on the 
general distribution of subterranean disturbing forces in operation through- 
out India. In 1845 he published a comprehensive account of the Asiatic 
earthquakes which occurred in 1843.^* Apart from these investigations, 
1. A. Hodgson and R. Everest studied glacial and river actions respectively. 

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF INDIA 

In 1835 the government became interested in making adequate supplies 
of coal for the steamers for purposes of navigation. In the very next year 
Governor-General Auckland constituted a committee for the investigations 
of coal and mineral resources of India, with John McClelland of the Medical 
Services as its Secretary. The committee enjoined on the government 
that immediate steps be taken for a ‘geological survey of the coal formation 
in India’. 

The economic value of the geological investigations proved of im- 
mediate concern to the East India Company, the coalfields of the eastern 
parts of India looming large in this respect. Then in Britain, geology 
more than chemistry had assumed importance as a very useful branch of 
science with far-reaching practical possibilities. The result was that in 
1835 the Geological Survey of Great Britain was formed. The British 
Association for the Advancement of Science (founded in 1831) came forward 
prudently enough to offer financial support to geological investigations. 
In this direction again the Indian coalfields and other mines looked very

attractive. On the initiative of McClelland, D. H. Williams of the British 
Geological Survey came to India in 1846, and his immediate concern was 
with the exploration of the coalfields in Raniganj, Jharia, Taldange, Dhanbad 
and Karanpura areas. He set about it in a planned way and in less than 
two years was able to survey a number of coalfields. It was the desire of 
Williams to conduct the investigations up the Damodar valley. However, 
towards the end of 1848 he got an attack of jungle fever and died in Hazari- 
bag. Truly Williams laid the foundation for the geological survey of India. 

In 1851 Thomas Oldham succeeded Williams as Superintendent of the 
Geological Survey of India. He was only 35 years of age then and already 
a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, Professor of Geology in the 
University of Dublin, Local Director of the Geological Survey of Ireland, 
and President of the Geological Society, Dublin.® With his coming to 
India, the geological investigations became broadbased and more purpose- 
ful as he undertook in an effective manner a systematic geological survey 
of India. In this task Oldham received great encouragement from 
Governor-General Canning who evinced abiding interest in the geological 
explorations. As a consequence, officially, the Geological Survey of India 
was established as a Government Department. The object of the new 
organization, as assented to by the Governor-General, was to have ^coalfields 
of this country systematically surveyed*. As a result, in the next two 
decades the Survey’s activities were in the main confined to protracted 
investigations of coalfields in Jharia, Bokaro, Narmada valleys, etc. 

The Geological Survey of India made rapid progress and had to its 
credit a number of achievements in the later half of the nineteenth century, 
under the successive directions of Thomas Oldham, H. B. Medlicott, 
William King and C. L. Griesbach. A concise and authentic account of 
the steps taken by Oldham to place the new organization on a solid founda- 
tion, and also the varied investigations of the Survey have been given in the 
publication issued in 1951 on the occasion of the centenary of the Survey. 
While the reader is referred to this publication, as also the papers, reports 
and notes which appeared particularly in the Memoirs and Records of the 
Geological Survey of India, the following briefly highlights some of the 
important geologists and their main investigations up to the end of the 
nineteenth century. 

Thomas Oldham 

Oldham was indeed a meticulous and imaginative investigator, who 
brought to bear upon his investigations a rare insight nurtured by deep 
experience, the impact of which was felt by his co-workers as well as those who 
followed him. Among his co-officers were J. G. Medlicott, W. Theobald, 
H, B. Medlicott, W. T. Blanford and H. F. Blanford. His early works in 
India related to the examination of the Khasi hills, Damodar valley, Rajmahal

hills, the entire coal-producing context of the Bengal region and the coal belts 
of the Satpura range. 

He proposed the name Vindhyan^ to connote the great Sandstone 
Formation of the northern and central India, and indicated that the Vindhyan, 
noted as it is for the absence of organic remains, could not well be cor- 
related with any of the great European formations. This led him to believe 
that it might be Cambrian. He was able to establish the identity of the 
vast thick layers of sandstones and shales with plant fossils which lay on 
the Vindhyan, with the coal groups of Burdwan, Hazaribag and Cuttack. 
He gave the name Mahadevas^ to the series of thick and ferruginous sand- 
stones. With great ingenuity he classified different rock groups'^ and was 
hopeful of finding an accurate parallelism between the rocks of India and 
those of Australia. 

Oldham also initiated the study of the earthquakes in India.^^ Under 
his able guidance, the first catalogue of the Indian earthquakes as also a 
list of some 300 thermal springs" in India were compiled. Further, it was 
Oldham who realized the necessity and importance of training some Indians 
as geologists through apprenticeship. He followed it up by recruiting Ram 
Singh (1873), Kishen Singh and Hira Lai (1874). 

H, B. Medlicott 

H. B. Medlicott, who was Professor of Natural History and Economic 
Geology at the Thomson College of Engineering at Roorkee,-^ joined the 
Geological Survey in 1854, and worked with Oldham. He studied the 
Himalayan geology from 1857 to 1861. He also threw light on the 
glacial action relating to the great blocks of gneissose granite along the 
base of the Dhuladhar in the Kangra valley.^ His survey of the northern 
side of the Narmada valley enabled him to confirm the threefold division 
of Yindhyans. He showed that the rocks of the Raipur basin did not 
belong to the coal-bearing series. It was Medlicott who suggested the 
term Gondwana^ for the great southern continent. In 1876 Medlicott 
succeeded Oldham as Superintendent, and was designated as Director of 
the Geological Survey of India in 1885. 


W. T. Blanford and others 

W. T. Blanford, who joined the Geological Survey in 1885, was a 
geologist of distinction. He surveyed the Raniganj coalfield (1858-1860), 
and recognized three different groups of rocks there.^ He prepared a 
geological map detailed on the scale 1" : 1 mile which was first to be pub- 
lished on that scale. Further, he examined the physical geography of the

great Indian desert,® and surveyed also the eastern and northern frontiers 
of Sikkim. Both Oldham and Blanford worked on the correlation and 
classification of the peninsular formation of India. Blanford and his 
brother, H. F. Blanford, along with W. Theobald examined the Talchir 
boulder-beds in the Cuttack district and ascribed their origin to ice action. 
For his distinguished work, Blanford was awarded the famous Wollaston 
Gold Medal by the Geological Society of London.^ Another noted geologist 
was 0. Feistmantel who studied the plant fossils and attempted to classify 
the Gondwana System based on them. 

In the south, H. F. Blanford examined the geology of the Nilgiri hills.<^ 
F. Stoliczka, who was another geologist working in the south, brought out in 
four volumes the Cretaceous fauna of southern India. Bruce Foot investi- 
gated the southern regions of Trichinopoly as well as Bellary areas. V. Ball 
was another noted geologist of the Survey, who made distinct contributions 
to the understanding of the geology of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. 
The rocks of the Nicobar were shown by him to be coral, magnesium 
claystone with conglomerates, gabbro and serpentine in confirmation of 
the earlier observations of Hochstetter.^ 

William King (who succeeded H. B. Medlicott in 1887 as Director of 
the Geological Survey of India) discovered the Singareni coalfields in the 
State of Hyderabad. In 1872 T. H. Holland discovered large deposits 
of high-grade iron ore, chromite and magnesite in the Salem district of 
Madras, and corundum in Mysore. In 1893 he came across an acidic 
pyroxene-bearing (hypcrsthene) rock in the Madras Province, and to this 
he proposed the name Charnockite in memory of Job Chamock, the founder 
of Calcutta.® 

‘Among the results which have influenced the course of geological 
science may be placed the recognition of the importance of deposits formed 
in land, the great Vindhyan and Gondwana System and the Gangetic 
alluvium being revealed as land deposits. The recognition of the Upper 
carboniferous glacial epoch in India, extending into Australia, South Africa 
and South America, gave rise to the conception of the vast southern conti- 
nent of Gondwanaland. The study of the Assam earthquake, in 1897, led 
to the discovery of three main types of earthquake waves — a discovery that 
has proved so fruitful in investigations regarding the internal structure of 
the earth. The rich fossil manunalian fauna of the Siwahk hills, described 
in a series of brilliant Memoirs which adorn the museums of the world, 
throw light on the evolution of the mammals and even of man himself.’-^ 

Pramatha Nath Bose 

In 1851 when the Geological Survey of India formed its nucleus, there 
were only one superintendent and two assistants, and in 1861 the number

of officers rose to 12. However, it was not before 1873 that the Indian 
apprentices were able to join the Survey and participate in the geological 
investigations, even as subordinate assistants. The honour of being the 
first Indian to hold a graded position in the Geological Survey of India 
belonged to P. N. Bose (1880). P. N. Dutta was another who joined the 
organization in 1888. By the end of the century there were fourteen officers 
in the Geological Survey out of whom only two were Indians. Both P. N. 
Bose and Dutta were geologists of high distinction. The former mapped 
the Vindhyans and the igneous rocks of Raipur and Balaghat areas of the 
Central Provinces. P. N. Bose was the first to give accounts of micro- 
sections of rocks in the progress reports. P. N. Dutta discovered the vast 
deposits of manganese ore in the Bandara and Chhindwara river valley 
(1893-1894), besides the Devonian and Mesozoic beds of the northern Shan 
States.

districts, Central Provinces. (Reproduced from Bose (P. N.) (2), p. 61.) 

P. N. Bose retired from the Geological Survey in 1903 when T. H. 
Holland (who joined the organization eight years later than he) succeeded 
him as Director. Bose’s geological acumen attracted the attention of the 
Maharaja of Mayurbhanj and, as a result, he became the State Geologist 
of Mayurbhanj. It was largely due to his efforts that the extensive as well 
as rich deposits of iron ore in that State were discovered. Later, there 
came about an accidental meeting between Bose and the renowned in- 
dustrialist J. N. Tata who, on the advice of the former, soon took active 
steps for establishing an iron and steel works at the present location at 
Jamshedpur. 

Apart from the geological investigations with which the Geological 
Survey was primarily concerned, it had realized the importance of imparting 
education in geology at collegiate level. As early as 1892, it moved in this 
matter and even permitted one of its officers to work as part-time Professor

of Geology at the Presidency College, Calcutta. T. H. Holland was the 
first professor of this type. The Geological Survey also began to recruit 
several specialists in mining and metallurgy towards the close of the nine- 
teenth century, during the time of C. L. Grieshback, and these specialists 
constituted the nucleus of staff of the Department of Mines and Inspection 
which, first organized in 1902, was later designated as the Department of 
Mines." 


THE INDIAN MUSEUM 

The scientific investigations conducted by the members of the Asiatic 
Society in different parts of the country and on different branches of 
natural history necessarily led to the accumulation of a wide variety of 
materials and curios such as the ancient relics, coins, plant specimens and 
minerals. Though the Society did not conceive of the establishment of a 
museum, gradually it was realized that the accumulated objects deserved 
preservation. As early as 1796, the idea gained ground that a suitable house 
be built for their reception, preservation and presentation. But the Asiatic 
Society itself had to wait till 1808 to move into a house of its own. In 1814 
Nathaniel Wallich entered a powerful plea for the establishment of a museum 
to house * the object of science and of those reliques which illustrate ancient 
times and manners’. To quote from his note submitted to the Asiatic 
Society for this purpose: ‘It is, however, in the department of science that 
a museum in this country would be found most specially serviceable and 
the facility of the accumulation is proportionable to the extent of its utility. 
In natural history, botany, anatomy, chemistry, mineralogy, and other 
branches, a collection would accumulate rapidly if once commenced; and 
from the first moment of the accumulation would furnish additional matter 
into the stock of knowledge.’*' And in 1814 the Asiatic Society resolved 
that a museum be formed ‘for the reception of all articles that may tend 
to illustrate oriental manners and history, or to elucidate the peculiarities 
of art and nature in the East’. The last included the native manufactures, 
animal skeletons, birds (stulfed or preserved), dried plants and fruits, 
minerals of every description, metals and alloys. Wallich was rightly 
chosen as the Honorary Superintendent of the ‘Oriental Museum of the 
Asiatic Society’. The museum was broadly divided into two sections: 
(i) archaeological, ethnological and technical; and (ii) geological and zoo- 
logical. The collections of Wallich, Colonel Stuart, Tytler, General 
Mackenzie, Brian Hodgson, Captain Dillon and Babu Ram Kamal Sen 
were among the first curious objects of the museum. After the resignation 
of Wallich, curators were appointed from time to time on payment of small 
amounts for longer or shorter periods. 

In 1835 the Government of India, encouraged by the working of coal 
mines and the discovery of new minerals, conceived the idea of founding a

Museum of Economic Geology at Calcutta,"*^ and provided necessary 
financial assistance to the Asiatic Society to preserve the government’s 
collection. In 1836, however, when the finances of the Asiatic Society 
were crippled as a result of the failure of its Bankers, attempts were made 
to get a grant from the government with a view to employing a paid whole- 
time curator on a modest monthly salary to look after the ‘public depositary 
of the products of nature in India’ under the care of the Society. But it 
was not till 1839 that the Court of Directors in London could sanction the 
grant for the salary of the curator, maintenance of the museum and for 
certain other purposes. In the meantime the Society persisted in its demand 
and presented a second petition for securing a temporary grant, which 
met with the approval of the government. J. T. Pearson of the Bengal 
Medical Service was appointed Curator who was succeeded by McClelland, 
the distinguished ichthyologist. In 1841 Edward Blyth who was chosen 
by H. H. Wilson in England became the paid whole-time Curator. 

As noted above, the Society with the financial support of the govern- 
ment had also preserved the government’s collection of minerals, fossils 
and the like under the name of Museum of Economic Geology, In May 
1841 Captain G. D. Tremenheere, who was sent by the government to 
England to procure more such collections, returned with a large treasure 
of specimens of minerals which needed preservation and proper arrange- 
ment. But as Blyth was not by training a geologist, the necessity arose 
for employing yet another curator for the management of the geological 
collections for which purpose Piddington was appointed. The Curators 
Blyth and Piddington steadily built up the collections, classified the exhibits 
and brought to light the scientific knowledge latent in them. In 1856 the 
collections owned by the Government were removed and displayed at in the 
office of the Geological Survey of India. In the meantime, the archaeo- 
logical and zoological collections continued to pour into the Asiatic Society 
building. 

Time was now ripe for the foundation of a well-planned museum in 
Calcutta.^^ The Asiatic Society took the initiative between the years 1856 
and 1858, and negotiated with the government for the transfer of its own 
collections to such a public museum under certain terms. In 1867 came into 
being the Indian Museum under the Act No. XVII of 1866 passed by the 
Governor-General of India in March 1866. The Act envisaged: ‘The 
Governor-General of India in Council shall cause to be created, at the 
expense of the Government of India, a suitable building in Calcutta or near 
the site now occupied by the Small Cause Court, to be devoted in part to 
collections illustrative of the Indian archaeology and of the several branches 
of the Natural History, in part to the preservation and exhibition of other 
objects of interest, whether historical or economical, in part to the records 
of the offices of the Geological Survey of India, and in part to the fit 
accommodation of the Asiatic Society of Bengal’ The names of Trustees

of the Museum were also proposed, with Barnes Peacock, the then Chief 
Justice of Bengal, as the President. 

John Anderson, who had served earlier as Professor of Natural Science 
in Free Church College at Edinburgh, became the first Curator® of the new 
Museum in September 1866. In recognition of his knowledge, Anderson 
was also permitted by the Board of Trustees to hold the professorship of 
anatomy at the Medical College, Calcutta, in addition to his duties at the 
Museum. James Wood-Mason, who assisted Anderson in organizing the 
Museum for about 16 years, succeeded the latter as Superintendent of the 
Museum in 1886. 

The Asiatic Society made over its rich collections of zoological, geo- 
logical and archaeological objects to the Board of Trustees of the Museum. 
Later the Society was paid 1 1 lac of rupees as compensation for its claim 
to accommodation in the projected building for the Museum. The building 
itself became ready for occupation in 1875. On the first of April 1878, 
the galleries were thrown open to the public. Immediately after the Great 
Exhibition which was held at Calcutta in 1883, the industrial collections 
displayed at the exhibition had to be amalgamated into the Indian Museum. 
The new display sector needed additional accommodation and in 1891 a 
new wing in Sudder Street came up for this purpose. 

The Indian Museum, based on the pattern of British Museum, is indeed 
an interesting and valuable assemblage of the scientific and the artistic 
sections. The public galleries are divided into (i) archaeological, (ii) 
geological, (iii) industrial, (iv) zoological, (v) anthropological (ethnological) 
and (vi) art sections. The last is the only section in charge of the Trustees 
of the Museum while the others are under the respective departments of 
the Government of India. The zoological and anthropological sections of 
the Museum gave rise to the Zoological Survey of India in 1916. 

ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES 

As noted already, the botanical investigations registered rapid progress 
in the first quarter of the nineteenth century mainly because of the devoted 
efforts, among others, of the two eminent botanists, William Roxburgh and 
Nathanial Wallich. The same, however, cannot be said of zoological 
researches. It would appear that no zoological study worth the name 
was carried out till then, and the main reason was lack of interest in zoology 
as such. Even such of the members of the Asiatic Society as were avowedly 
naturalists did not seem to be particularly concerned with zoological re- 
searches. William Jones who was so fond of natural history, strangely 
enough, gave expression to his disinterestedness in zoological studies in his 
tenth anniversary discourse to the Society, and wondered: ‘Could the 
figure, instincts, and qualities be ascertained either on the plan of Bufifon, 
or on that of Linnaeus without giving pain to the object of our examination? 


* A few years later the designation was changed into Superintendent.

Few studies would afford us more solid instruction or more exquisite de- 
light; but I never could learn by what right, nor conceive with what feeling, 
a naturalist can occasion the misery of an innocent bird, and leave its young, 
perhaps, to perish in a cold nest, because it has gay plumage, and has never 
been delineated, or deprive even a butterfly of its natural enjoyment, because 
it has the misfortune to be rare or beautiful.’® The compassion for the 
zoological objects was so strong in William Jones that he could not lend 
his weight to their studies. 

Right at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Governor-General 
Wellesley took the initiative to establish a college at Fort William and attach 
to it a natural history department located at Barrackpore with a view to 
studying birds and other animals, under the leadership of Francis Buchanan. 
Between 1800 and 1804, many live animals arrived at Barrackpore sent by 
officials from different parts of the Company’s territories. The institution 
soon languished for want of support from Wellesley’s successor. In the 
French possession of Pondichery Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour and 
his associates collected and examined a number of zoological specimens.^ 


Hodgson and Ticked 

Early in the nineteenth century, however, Major-General Hardwicke 
of the Bengal Artillery and Captain Sykes of the Bombay Army made 
attempts to collect and describe some mammalian specimens, as also birds 
and insects. The first notable zoological study was in 1829 when Brian 
Houghton Hodgson published a paper on a new species of BucerosS 
Hodgson, who was in Nepal as assistant to the Resident at Kathmandu for 
over twenty years from 1823, collected, with the assistance of local hunters, 
a large number of mammals and birds, and studied them minutely. One 
of the first animals studied by him was the serow named by him as Antilope 
Thar A His unceasing investigations brought to light new species of Para- 
doxurus (three in number), Cervus, Falconidae, Mercelinc birds, Indian 
snipes, porcupines, Plecotus, Talpa macruka, a new genus of the Plantigrada, 
Sylviidae, Meropidae, etc.® The most remarkable studies of Hodgson 
were on the birds of Nepal and the animal named by him as Takin. His 
observations on the two new flying squirrels, mammals of Tibet, tame 
sheep and goats of the sub-Himalayas and Tibet, polecat, stag, some rumi- 
nants, monkeys, musk-deer, otter, chiru antelope and the like are characterized 
by ‘deep research and great acumen, and are very full in details of struc- 
ture’.-^ The Catalogue of his drawings and specimens of mammals and 
birds from Nepal and Tibet presented to the British Museum was published 
in 1847. It lists one hundred and fifteen species, of which about ten were 
from Tibet. While living in Darjeeling, between 1845 and 1858, he wrote

an important article entitled ‘Physical Geography of the Himalayas’ in 
which he described three altitudinal areas and the associated animals. 
Hodgson was indeed a classical worker on the Indian vertebrates. 

In 1839 Walter Elliot, both an archaeologist and geologist, published 
a catalogue of the species of mammalia found in the southern Maharashtra 
country, which contains details of as many as 58 species. 

Indian ornithology attained a new height as a result of the protracted 
studies of Lt. S. R. TickelP who is regarded as one of the best field naturalists 
of India. For nearly 30 years he studied scientifically a number of different 
birds, their eggs and nests, and prepared descriptive lists of them. His 
observations on the birds of Borabhum and Dholbhum are of special merit.^ 
He contributed to the knowledge of sloth bear, brown flying squirrel, 
ant-eater and the gibbons. In addition, he brought to light a new species 
of hornbill as well as a supposed new genus of the Gadidae of Arkan.^ The 
manuscript prepared by him on the Indian mammals and birds, with ade- 
quate illustrations, is still preserved in the library of the Zoological Society 
of London. Blanford made use of the material of this manuscript when 
he wrote the Mammals in The Fauna of British India series. 

Blyth 

E. Blyth who, as stated before, was the first Curator of the Asiatic Society 
Museum worked on birds and mammals for about 22 years. His study 
included the specimens from India, Burma, Ceylon, Afghanisthan and the 
Malay Peninsula. He prepared, with characteristic zeal and care for 
minute details, The Catalogues of Birds ((1849; issued in 1852) and Mammalia 
(1863) which were in the Asiatic Society’s collection. His investigations 
covered the species of wild sheep, predatory and sanguinvorous habits of 
Magaderma, lynx, Cuculidae, some little known birds, mole, orangutan, 
Phylloscopus, new Indian pigeon akin to the ‘stock-dove’ of Europe, 
reindeer, certain types of asses and the like.^ In 1862 he retired to England 
because of ill health. It is interesting to note that Charles Darwin fre- 
quently quoted Blyth as an excellent authority and even referred to him 
as one of the finest zoologists of his time. It has been rightly recognized that 
‘Blyth was certainly the founder in this country of a school of what may 
be called field zoologists. The active correspondence he kept up with the 
sportsmen-naturalists in various parts of the country, and his elaborate 
notices of the presentations which were made by them to the Society, not 
to speak of his numerous Memoirs, contributed an impetus to the study 
of natural history, which has done more to its extension in India than all 
the previous publications.’**

W. T. Blanford and others 

The versatile W. T. Blanford while engaged in geological work spared 
no efforts in collecting and describing the molluscs, reptiles, birds and 
mammals. His observation on the birds included those of central, western 
and southern India, as also the eastern and northern frontiers of Sikkim. 
He studied in detail the genus Gymnops (Lacertidae), the Sind ‘Ibex’, 
Markhor, the Indian antelope, Felis shawiana, Golunda elliottU Tracna- 
lopterum, Arvicola and a number of reptiles and amphibia.® In England, 
after retirement, Blanford was appointed the editor of a series of volumes on 
The Fauna of British India. He himself wrote the volume on mammals which 
was published between 1888 and 1891 as well as two volumes on birds. 

To the fields of herpetology and malacology W. Theobald made valu- 
able contributions. He investigated Batrachia, Helicidae and Gastropoda. 
For about 25 years he was engaged in the study of land and freshwater 
shells of India and Burma. Theobald also compiled the Catalogue of 
reptiles in the Museum of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. H. Benson, 
T. Hunter and W. T. Blanford were the other three investigators in 
this field. G. Nevil was noted for his study of marine and estuarine 
mollusca. H. Godwin-Austen described and catalogued a number of 
birds in various parts of Assam. G. E. Dobson prepared a monograph 
on the Asiatic Chiroptera and was recognized as one of the outstanding 
authorities on that order of the Mammalia. He studied some new species 
of Chiroptera verspertilio, Tiaenops persicum, Rhinolophine bats, Molossus 
and the like. F. Stoliezka devoted himself to a systematic study of the 
organism in mollusca and various other invertebrates and vertebrates. 
R. Lydekker is remembered for his studies of the fossil vertebrata of India 
and deer, antelopes, wild oxen, sheep and goat.^ 

The study of fishes also received due attention. McClelland produced 
a monograph on the Indian Cyprinidae, while E. Blyth, as noted already, 
was the author of several papers on fishes. The most remarkable investi- 
gators in this field were undoubtedly F. Day and Buchanan Hamilton. 
The former brought Out in two volumes an authoritative account of the 
fishes of India. 

The other noted zoologists who worked in India included A. L. Adams 
(mammals), Jerdon (wrote Birds and Mammals of India), Aitchison 
(mammals), A. O. Hume (mostly birds), Oldfield Thomas (genus Mus\ G. S. 
Rodon (bears and the Himalayan game animals) and R. C. Wroughton 
(rodents).® 

The scientific staff of the Indian Museum played a leading role in 
furtherance of zoological investigations which are too many to be described 
in detail in this short compass. Briefly,*^ a number of zoological notes

were prepared by Atkinson on Rhynchota. Investigations on Lepidoptera 
(in general butterflies and moths) were carried out by Moore, de Niceville, 
Wood-Mason and Elwes. T. Anderson worked on the new and little 
known Asiatic shrews. Spiders and mimic ants were studied by Walsh, 
and snakes by Sclater. Lt.-Colonel Alcock published a number of papers

on corals, actinians, crustaceans and other marine animals collected during 
his voyages on the Investigator. In collaboration with Frank Finn, Alcock 
also conducted investigation into the theory of warning colours (also known 
as aposometic colouration relating to the gaudy colours of some stinging 
insects). In addition, Alcock brought out his well-known work entitled 
Materials for a Carcinological Fauna of India (published in six parts from 
1885 to 19(X)) which contains valuable information on marine crabs of the 
Indo-Pacific region. 

In 1871 a committee (with Stoliczka, Blanford, Anderson, Wood-Mason, 
Oldham and others) constituted by the Asiatic Society recommended that

Marine Survey Department was established by the government. During 
the period 1874-1881, Armstrong was able to gather marine zoological 
material from shallow water up to a depth of 100 fathoms. Wood-Mason

AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY RESEARCH 

In the field of agricultural research no significant research programmes 
seemed to have been undertaken in the nineteenth century. The Famine 
Commission in 1880 recommended strongly the revival of the departments 
of agriculture both at the centre and in the provinces for improvement of 
agriculture and affording famine relief. It was only towards the end of 
the century that agricultural departments came into existence in a few places 
like Bombay (1885), Madras (1889), Shillong (1894), Allahabad (1895), 
Nagpur (1895) and Calcutta (1896).* In 1889-1891, J. A. Voelcker, Consult- 
ing Chemist to the Royal Agricultural Society, visited India at the invitation 
of the Secretary of State for India, and submitted a report on the improve- 
ment of agriculture in India. In 1903 the Indian Agricultural Institute 
was established at Pusa in Bihar. The origin of this institute can be traced 
not only to the recommendation by the Royal Agricultural Commission 
in 1896, which emphasized researches in agriculture, but also to a generous 
donation of £20,000 (afterwards raised to £30,000) made by Henry Phipps 
in 1903 with the request that the amount might be devoted to some object 
of public utility in India, preferably in the direction of scientific research 
(a part of this donation was later utilized for the establishment of the 
Pasteur Research Institute at Coonoor). The Government of India took 
steps for attaching a farm of some 1,300 acres to the Agricultural Institute 
for experimental cultivation and demonstration. Some advanced courses in 
agricultural education were also started in 1908. Consequent upon the 
earthquake which shook Bihar in 1934, the institute was moved to its 
present location in Delhi. 

The first step towards providing facilities for investigating into diseases 
of stock in India was taken in 1890 when Linard was appointed as Imperial 
Bacteriologist at the College of Science at Poona. His important duties 
included the determination as far as possible by biological research, of the 
means of preventing and curing such diseases. As the climatic conditions 
of Poona were not found conducive to such researches, the laboratory 
was shifted to Mukteswar in 1893.*^ In this laboratory, investigations on 
rinderpest were undertaken, and in the next five to six years a potent 
rinderpest serum was developed. Gradually the work on the preparation 
of anti-serums for anthrax and studies in Black quarter and Mallein were 
taken up. A course of instruction in tropical veterinary diseases and in 
serum therapeutics was also started.

MEDICAL INVESTIGATIONS 

Though the medical officers began serving the British Army in India 
as early as 1754,® and in the succeeding years, their number in the Indian 
Medical Service was steadily on the increase, medical research as such did 
not take place in India even up to the middle of the nineteenth cen- 
tury. Between 1847 and 1850, however, Edward Hare introduced success- 
fully the practice of administering quinine in fevers. Henry Vanoyke 
Carter and Crawford made some important dissections and prepared 
the woodcuts which illustrate Gray’s Anatomy. Carter also investigated 
the origin and development of famine fever, leprosy, elephantiasis and 
mycetoma. Ronald Ross worked on the origin of malarial fever and 
P. J. Freyer on the development of the operation of litholapaxy and prosta- 
tectomy, while Leonard Rogers conducted investigations on cholera, 
dysentery and liver abscess.* 

The now familiar Haffkine Institute at Bombay was started in 1896 
as the Plague Research Laboratory, with Dr. Waldemar Mordecai Wolff 
Haffkine as the Director. It was in 1896 that for the first time the dreadful 
plague, which probably travelled to India from China, was detected in 
Bombay in an epidemic form. Haffkine, who was at that time studying 
prophylactic inoculation against cholera in Bengal, was associated with a 
committee (constituted by the Government of Bombay) to enquire into 
this epidemic. Soon the necessity arose for establishing a laboratory for 
developing an effective vaccine against the disease. With ingenuity Haffkine 
was able within two months to prepare a broth vaccine against the plague 
bacilli, with which he carried out the inoculation of about 8,000 people 
in a few weeks. In 1906 the name of the laboratory where Haffkine 
worked was changed into Bombay Bacteriological Laboratory and in 1925 
to its present name, thus associating with it the name of Haffkine. The 
laboratory did work on the plague prophylactics, relapsing fever, grumic- 
worm disease and the like, gradually extending its investigations into the 
biochemical field also. 


ENGINEERING INVESTIGATIONS 

Certain types of investigations in engineering were in progress, par- 
ticularly in the later half of the nineteenth century. The railways, construc- 
tion of bridges, canal works, lock and dam systems including the regulators 
and devices for discharge of excess of water, improvement of rivers for 
navigation, construction of lighthouses, arches and the like, drainage and 
water supply demanded engineering skill of no mean order. As these had 
to be accomplished in the Indian conditions, the engineers had to make 
innovations. The profession of engineering, which was held in esteem, 
attracted into its fold able men who, amidst their routine, found time, 
prudently enough, to study not a few of the engineering problems and, in

the process, made original contributions. Details of such contributions can 
be noticed in a number of volumes of professional papers, the first of which 
came out in 1863 from Roorkee, one of the main centres of engineering 
activity then, under the editorship of J. G. Medley. A special study of 
these volumes is necessary before an attempt is made to present an authen- 
tic account from the point of view of the history as well as achievement of 
the engineering investigations in India. 

ARCHAEOLOGY 

Soon after its establishment, the Asiatic Society, under the guidance 
of William Jones, encouraged antiquarian studies in the classical texts and 
epigraphs, monuments and other architectural remains of India. Indian 
epigraphical studies took new strides due mainly to the devoted efforts 
of H. T. Colebrooke and H. H. Wilson. The impressive architectural 
remains and several cave paintings received attention of scholars like 
Malet (Ellora), Salt (Kanhari), Sykes (Ellora), Goldingham (Elephanta), 
Erskine (Ajanta), Chambers (Mahabalipuram) and Mackenzie (Amaravati), 
who out of love for the ancient relics of India brought to light their 
hidden history.® 

The antiquarian investigations were the forerunners of further efforts 
in field archaeology, and the latter assumed new meaning as a result of the 
lead given by James Prinsep. Prinsep also studied the Kharosihl and the 
Brahmi scripts. Markham Kittoe and Alexander Cunningham carried 
out work on the rock edicts of Asoka at Dhauli, and Dhamek stupa (1834- 
1835) at Saranath respectively. The latter was probably the earliest excava- 
tion of an ancient site in India, Later, Cunningham took up investigations 
on the Indo-Greek and Indo-Scythic dynasties, and identified the ancient 
site of Sankisa. Markham Kittoe surveyed the vihdras and chaityas in 
Gaya and elsewhere in Bihar, and continued the excavations initiated by 
Cunningham in the ruins at Saranath.*’ 

Edward Thomas specially studied the Indian numismatics from about 
the third century b.c. to the sixteenth century a.d. His work on the South 
Indian epigraphy is well known. J. Stevenson and Bhau Daji were the 
others who were engaged in the epigraphical studies in western India. 
Further, James Fergusson made an extensive architectural survey (1829- 
1847) of ancient buildings, while Meadows Taylor devoted particular 
attention to the megalithic tombs,^ 

In 1848 Cunningham emphasized the importance of undertaking an 
archaeological survey of the country with the support of the government. 
Realizing the necessity of such a survey, Governor-General Canning estab- 
lished the Archaeological Survey of India in 1861, befittingly with Cunning- 
ham as the first Archaeological Surveyor. In the next four years, Cunning- 
ham explored an extensive area from Gaya in the east to the Indus in the

north-west, and from Kalsi in the north to the Dhamnar caves in the south,® 
while Cunningham’s explorations were exclusively confined to north India. 
James Burgess investigated western and southern India.'’* ^ 

The prehistoric archaeology in India owes its inspiration to the pioneer 
efforts of H. P. L. Mesurier of the East India Railway (neoliths in the valley 
of the Tosney river) and Robert Bruce Foote of the Geological Survey 
(palaeoliths at Pallavaram).^* 

Towards the end of the nineteenth century, the archaeological depart- 
ment underwent some structural changes. In the beginning of the twentieth 
century, it received the necessary financial support and encouragement 
from the government, and in the next two to three decades, archaeology 
established itself in India. 

SCIENTinC PUBLICATIONS 

Admittedly it is almost an impossible task to give an exhaustive account 
of the scientific publications which came out in India during the nineteenth 
century in such a short survey as this. But as scientific publications are a 
reliable index to the nature and structure of the scientific activities in pro- 
gress, it is perhaps necessary to mention at least the important scientific 
publications. The transactions of the Asiatic Society continued to come 
out under the title Asiatick Researches till 1839 (first published in 1788; 
in all 20 volumes). In 1821 Wilson started the Quarterly Oriental Journal. 
This periodical and also the Transactions of the Medical and Physical 
Society carried short notes on important discoveries (which the Asiatick 
Researches by its very form could not publish). Both these stopped publica- 
tion in 1827. The demand for this serial was so great that more than 
one pirated edition was printed in Europe then. As stated already, on the 
efforts of James Prinsep (Secretary of the Asiatic Society), the Journal of 
the Asiatic Society of Bengal was started in 1832. Though largely devoted 
to literary publications, the Journal used to publish scientific papers also 
and superseded the Asiatick Researches. Between 1832 and 1904, as many 
as 75 volumes in two parts each (with several supplementary numbers) were 
published. From 1834 to 1847, the Indian Review and Journal of Foreign 
Science was published at Calcutta. 

In the field of medicine, there were a number of publications. Among 
them mention may be made of Transactions of the Medical and Physical 
Society (Calcutta: 1825-1845); Indian Journal of Medical Science (Calcutta: 
1834-1836); Indian Annals of Medical Science (Calcutta: 1853-1877); 
Madras Quarterly Journal of Medical Science (Madras: 1860-1868); Indian 
Medical Gazette (Calcutta: 1866 onwards); Madras Monthly Journal of 
Medical Science (Madras: 1870-1873); and Scientific Memoirs by the 
Medical Officers of the Army of India (Series : 1885).*

In zoology, several valuable publications in series appeared in the last 
three decades of the nineteenth century. Birds of India (by T. C. Jerdol, 
1862-1863); Stray Feathers (I-XI; edited by Hume, 1873-1888); Indian 
Lepidoptera (by Hewitson and Moore, 1879-1888); Game Birds of India, 
Burma and Ceylon (by Marshall, 1879-1881); Butterflies of India, Burma 
and Ceylon (by Marshall and de Niceville, 1882-1890); Natural History of 
the Mammalia of India and Ceylon (by Sterndale, 1884); Avifauna of the 
British India (by Murray, 1888-1890); a number of the Descriptive 
Catalogues of the collections of the Indian Museum; and Reports of the 
R.I.M.S. Investigator (started in 1887); Fauna of British India (edited by 
W. T. Blanford, 1888; the first of the series to be published by the 
authority of the Secretary of the State for India); and Fishes of India 
(by F. Day, 1875-1878) deserve special mention."* In addition, the Journal 
of the Bombay Natural History Society began to appear from 1886. 

As to geology, the Memoirs pertaining to the completed surveys and 
mineral investigations (started in 1856 and issued from time to lime), 
Palaeontologia Indica (started in 1861) and the Records (started in 1868 as 
an annual) merit particular attention. Further, the detached papers and 
reports, which had been accumulating since 1851, were collated in three 
volumes: vols. I and II by H. B. Medlicott and H. F. Blanford; and vol. 
Ill by Y. Ball and F. P. Mallet. 

Some noteworthy publications in botany have been indicated already. 
They related to the works of Roxburgh, Wallich and George King. As 
has been seen, the Botanical Survey of India began to publish the Annals 
from 1887 due to the efforts of King who also published a series of papers on 
the Flora of the Malay Peninsula (1889-1896). His successor David Prain 
brought out a scries under the title ‘Noviciae Indica’ (1889-1898). Barclay 
of the Bengal Medical Service published another series on the parasitic 
Rust Fungi (of the order Uredinae), between the years 1886 and 1891.^ 

In meteorology. Memoirs (started by H. F. Blanford in 1876), Indian 
Meteorologist's Vade Mecum and Climate of India, Burma and Ceylon by 
Blanford; Handbook of Cyclonic Storms in the Bay of Bengal and Climato- 
logical Atlas by Eliot deserve special mention. Apart from the foregoing 
there were a number of other publications including periodicals relating to 
different branches of science published by the newly formed societies as well as 
some government organizations in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. 

SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION 

Education in India in the early part of the nineteenth century was 
neither widespread nor designed towards the promotion of science as well as 
technical arts and crafts. A few centres of learning then functioning in 
Bengal, Bombay and Madras were largely concerned with traditional 
learning and narrow scholasticism. In the first two decades of the century 
a number of missionary schools sprang up in and near Calcutta as well as

in the Presidencies of Bombay and Madras. The distressing fact was that 
all those institutions, besides being ill equipped, did not attempt to enthuse 
the young minds to develop a rational spirit beyond the confines of the 
traditional ideas. 

Minto's Remarks 

Lord Minto in his minute on the subject of education in India observed 
in 1811 as follows: ‘It is a common remark that science and literature are 
in a progressive state of decay among the natives of India. From every 
inquiry which I have been enabled to make on this interesting subject, 
that remark appears to me but too well founded. The number of the 
learned is not only diminished, but the circle of learning, even among 
those who still devote themselves to it, appears to be considerably contracted. 
The abstract sciences are abandoned, polite literature neglected, and no 
branch of learning cultivated but what is connected with the peculiar 
religious doctrines of the people. The immediate consequence of this state 
of things is, the disuse, and even actual loss, of many valuable books; and 
it is to be apprehended, that unless government interpose with a fostering 
hand, the revival of letter may shortly become hopeless, from want of 
books, or of persons capable of explaining them. 

‘The principal cause of the present neglected state of literature in India 
is to be traced to the want of that encouragement which was formerly 
afforded to it by princes, chieftains, and opulent individuals under the 
native government. Such encouragement must always operate as a strong 
incentive to study and literary exertions, but especially in India, where the 
learned professions have little, if any, other support. The justness of these 
observations might be illustrated by a detailed consideration of the former 
and present state of science and literature at the three principal seats of 
Hindoo learning, viz. Benares, Tirhoot and Nuddea. Such a review would 
bring before us the liberal patronage which was formerly bestowed, not 
only by princes and others in power and authority but also by the zamindars, 
on persons who had distinguished themselves by the successful cultivation 
of letters at those places. It would equally bring to our view the present 
neglected state of learning at those once-celebrated places; and we should 
have to remark with regret that the cultivation of letters was now confined 
to the few surviving persons who had been patronized by the native princes 
and others, under the former governments, or to such of the immediate 
descendants of those persons as had imbibed a love of science from their 
parents. 

‘It is seriously to be lamented that a nation particularly distinguished 
for its love, and successful cultivation of letter in other parts of the Empire, 
should have failed to extend its fostering care to the literature of the 
Hindoos and to aid in opening to the learned in Europe the repositories 
of that literature.’®

The Charier of 1813 

In Britain then attempts were being made by some enlightened members 
of Parliament to make the East India Company assume legal responsibility 
for educating the Indians. In 1813 when the Charter was renewed, a clause 
was introduced which stated thus : ‘And be it further enacted, that it shall 
be lawful for the Governor-General in Council to direct that out of any 
surplus which may remain of the rents, revenues, and profits arising from 
the said territorial acquisitions, after defraying the expenses of the military, 
civil, and commercial establishments, and paying the interest of the debt, 
in manner hereinafter provided, a sum of a not less than one lac of rupees 
in each year shall be set apart and applied to the revival and improvement 
of literature, and the encouragement of the learned natives of India, and 
for the introduction and promotion of a knowledge of the sciences among 
the inhabitants of the British territories in India; and that any schools, 
public lectures, or other institutions, for the purposes aforesaid, which 
shall be founded at the Presidencies of Fort William, Fort St. George, or 
Bombay, or in any other parts of the British territories in India, in virtue 
of this Act, shall be governed by such Regulations as may from time to time 
be made by the said Governor-General in Council; subject, nevertheless, 
to such powers as are herein vested in the said Board of Commissioners for 
the Affairs of India, respecting colleges and seminaries; provided always, 
that all appointments of offices in such schools, lecturerships, and other 
institutions, shall be made by or under the authority of the governments 
within which the same shall be situated.’® 

Mahavidyalaya 

For various reasons, however, the proposal could not be implemented 
for a decade. In 1816 the reputed social reformer Raja Ram Mohan Roy 
started a school at Suripara in Calcutta for teaching the Hindu boys in 
English. In May 1866 some liberal-minded gentlemen of Calcutta includ- 
ing David Hare (an ordinary watch-maker by profession but a great philan- 
thropist), Raja Ram Mohan Roy, the Raja of Burdwan, Raja Radha Kanta 
Deb and Sir Hyde East, the then Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, 
collected over a lac of rupees, and on 20 January 1817 founded a ‘Seminary 
for the instructions of the sons of the Hindus in the European and Asiatic 
languages and sciences’. The subjects taught included arithmetic, astron- 
omy, chemistry and natural philosophy. It was indeed a rare institution 
divided into two sections — a school which imparted instructions in English, 
Bengali, grammar and arithmetic, and a college in which were taught, 
besides the languages, the sciences including astronomy, mathematics and 
chemistry. A fact of great significance was that teaching of English was 
given an important place in this institution which was named at that time 
the Mahdvidydlaya or MahdpdfhaMld.^ Later it became the Hindu College 


Sharp, p. 22. 


* Dhar, pp. 128-36. 



544 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDU 


and also the nucleus of the present Presidency College at Calcutta. Of 
particular significance is the fact that the Hindu College nourished young 
men who subsequently devoted themselves to the spread of English edu- 
cation. In the beginning the institution had a strength of only 20 students 
and for several years the number did not exceed 70. Between 1817 and 
1824 the institution was managed entirely by a joint committee of Europeans 
and Indians. According to the progress report of the institution (1827- 
1828), the studies included natural and experimental philosophy, chemistry, 
mathematics, algebra, Tytler's Elements of General History, RussePs Modern 
Europe, works of Milton and Shakespeare, the number of students being 
436.® 

Soon the Vidyalaya ran into financial difficulties and when the pecuniary 
aid from the government was sought, the latter thought it wise to exercise 
some control over the affairs of the institution. Thus was appointed H. H. 
Wilson as Visitor to the Vidyalaya to represent the General Committee of 
Public Instruction. The institution had already earned the remark of 
the General Committee of Public Instruction (1831) that ‘a command of 
English language and a familiarity with its literature and science had been 
acquired (by this institution) to an excellence rarely equalled by any school 
in Europe. A taste for English has been widely disseminated and indepen- 
dent schools conducted by young men reared in the Vidyalaya are springing 
up in every direction’. 

The General Committee*' itself was set up by the East India Company 
in 1823 to promote the objectives of the Clause of the renewed Charter 
of the Company. The Committee had ten members and the great Oriental 
scholar H. H. Wilson was its Secretary. As it happened the Committee 
sought to encourage Oriental learning in preference to the ‘useful knowledge’ 
(sciences). The Committee’s attempt met with a wave of disapproval 
at home and in England. 

Raja Ram Mohan Rofs Petition 

At home, Raja Ram Mohan Roy exhorted Governor-General Lord 
Amherst to encourage instruction in scientific subjects, and not ‘to lead 
the minds of youths with grammatical niceties and metaphysical distinc- 
tions of little or no practical use to the possessors or to society’. In his 
historic petition to the Governor-General, Ram Mohan Roy emphasized 
as follows: ‘Humbly reluctant as the natives of India are to obtrude upon 
the notice of government the sentiments they entertain on any public 
measure, there are circumstances when silence would be carrying this re- 
spectful feeling to culpable excess. The present rulers of India, coming 
from a distance of many thousand miles, to govern a people whose lan- 
guage, literature, manners, customs, and ideas which are almost entirely new 
and strange to them, cannot easily become so intimately acquainted with

545 


their real circumstances as the natives of the coimtry are themselves. We 
should, therefore, be guilty of a gross dereliction of duty to ourselves, and 
afford our rulers just ground of complaint at our apathy, did we omit, on 
occasions of importance like the present, to supply them with such accurate 
information as might enable them to devise and adopt measures calculated 
to be beneficial to the country, and thus second by our local knowledge 
and experience, their declared benevolent intentions for its improvements. 

‘The establishment of a new Sanskrit School in Calcutta evidences 
the laudable desire of government to improve the natives of India by edu- 
cation— a blessing for which they must ever be grateful; and every well- 
wisher of the human race must be desirous that the efforts made to promote 
it should be guided by the most enlightened principles, so that the stream 
of intelligence may flow in the most useful channels. 

^When this seminary of learning was proposed, we understood that the 
government in England had ordered a considerable sum of money to be 
annually devoted to the instruction of its Indian subjects. We were filled 
with sanguine hopes that this sum would be laid out in employing European 
gentlemen of talents and education to instruct the natives of India in 
mathematics, natural philosophy, chemistry, anatomy and other useful 
sciences, which the nations of Europe have carried to a degree of perfection 
that has raised them above the inhabitants of other parts of the world. 

'While we looked forward with pleasing hope to the dawn of knowledge 
thus promised to the rising generation, our hearts were filled with mingled 
feelings of delight and gratitude; we already offered our thanks to Provi- 
dence for inspiring the most generous and enlightened nations of the West 
with the glorious ambition of planting in Asia the arts and sciences of 
modern Europe. 

'We find that the government are establishing a Sanskrit School under 
Hindu Pandits, to impart such knowledge as is already current in India . . . 
This seminary (similar in character to those which existed in Europe before 
the time of Lord Bacon) can only load the minds of youth with grammatical 
niceties and metaphysical distinctions, of little or no practical use to the 
possessors or to society. The pupils will thereby acquire what was known 
two thousand years ago, with the addition of vain and empty subtilties 
since produced by speculative men, such as is already commonly taught in 
all parts of India. 

'The Sanskrit language, so difi&cult that almost a lifetime is necessary 
for its acquisition, is well known to have been, for ages, a lamentable check 
on the diffusion of knowledge; and the learning, concealed under this 
almost impervious veil, is far from sufficient to reward the labour of ac- 
quiring it . . 

In England, the Court of Directors of the East India Company repri- 
manded the Committee by saying that *it was encouraging a great deal 
of what was frivolous and mischievous in Oriental learning*.^ There also

ensued between the two groups of members of the Committee the well- 
known controversy between the Anglicists (who were supporters of English 
and Western education) and the Orientalists (who sought to promote 
oriental learning in classical languages). 

English Education 

At that time Lord Macaulay came to India (1834) and Lord William 
Bentinck was the Governor-General in Council. Macaulay as the President 
of the General Committee recommended (in February 1835) the use of 
English as medium of instruction and the promotion of Western learning. 
He said: ‘I think it is clear that we are not fettered by pledge expressed or 
implied; that we are free to employ our funds as we choose; that we ought 
to employ them in teaching what is best worth knowing; that Engh’sh is 
better worth knowing than Sanskrit or Arabic; that the natives are desirous 
to be taught English, and are not desirous to be taught Sanskrit or Arabic; 
that neither as the languages of law nor as the languages of religion have 
Sanskrit and Arabic any peculiar claim to our encouragement; that it is 
possible to make the natives of this country thoroughly good English 
scholars, and that to this end our efforts ought to be directed.’® Bentinck 
(in March 1835) directed that all funds be employed for imparting to the 
native population a knowledge of English literature and science through the 
medium of English language and that no portion of it should be expended 
on the printing of Oriental works. Nevertheless, as before, a knowledge 
of English literature and science was not to be imparted on a massive scale, 
for it was meant for the upper classes who in turn were expected to ‘filter 
it down to the masses’. In the next two years twelve new schools were 
started in the Bengal Presidency alone. The public response for English 
education was on the increase. By 1838, there were some six thousand 
pupils taking up new courses in English. Governor-General Lord Hardinge 
declared in a resolution (1844) thus: ‘In every possible case a preference 
shah be given in the selection of candidates for public employment to those 
who have been educated in institutions thus established, and specially to 
those who have distinguished themselves therein by more than ordinary 
degree of merit and attainment.’^ 

In the Presidency of Bombay, a society for the promotion of education 
was formed in 1815 and it established schools in Bombay, Surat, Thana 
and Broach. Chaplain, who was Commissioner in the Deccan, founded 
the Hindu College at Poona in 1821 and the course of instruction at this 
college included mathematics, astronomy and medicine. However, it was 
the then Governor of Bombay, Monstaurt Elphinstone, who gave a signi- 
ficant direction to the growth of education in the Bombay Presidency. He 
encouraged Vernacular education while English was taught as one of the 
languages. Later the Bombay Board of Education, created in 1840, took 
active steps towards the promotion of English education in the Presidency.

In Madras, the spread of English education was not so rapid at the 
beginning of the nineteenth century. However, the missionary schools 
were very active imparting general education. It appeared that the Chris- 
tian missionaries were more successful there among the Tamil population 
than in any other part of India. The Protestant Mission, under the patron- 
age of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, which established 
schools at Madras, Tanjore and Trichinopoly, continued to be active. A 
few more schools were founded at Palamcottah, Thirunelveli, Ramanatha- 
puram and Sivaganga. But the Committee of Public Instruction which 
was constituted in 1826 as a result of the efforts of Sir Thomas Munro was 
not so active as it was expected to be. The Court of Directors in their 
Despatch of September 1830 enjoined: ‘We wish that there should be an 
English teacher at each institution who should not only give instruction in 
the English language but who may likewise be capable of assisting the 
students in the study of European science.’ 

By and large in the three Presidencies, the position with regard to 
general education including courses in science was far from being satis- 
factory. In the meantime, the Orientalists continued to take energetic 
steps to promote oriental learning. Conflicting views and disproportionate 
efforts, which appeared to raise their heads now and then, seemed to be 
detrimental to the spread and growth of the new knowledge including 
scientific subjects. 

Establishment of Universities 

In the history of education in India, the year 1854 is important, for 
in that year came out the famous Educational Despatch of Charles Wood 
(later Lord Halifax) who was then the President of the Board of Control. 
The Wood’s Despatch had as its primary object *the diffusion of the im- 
proved arts, science, philosophy and literature of Europe; in short of 
European knowledge’. It also recommended the creation of the depart- 
ments of Public Instruction in Bengal, Madras, Bombay, the North-Western 
Provinces and the Panjab, each under a Director of Public Instruction. 
With this machinery the general education, and as a part of it science 
education, was to be imparted on a massive scale. In addition, three 
universities were to be established on the model of London University. 
Even though Wood recognized that the education of the country’s rural 
population should be the direct responsibility of the government, he wanted 
the universities 'to place the benefits of education plainly and practically 
before the higher classes in India’. 

The three universities, which were established at Calcutta® (January 
1857), Bombay (July 1857) and Madras (September 1857), were only affiliat- 
ing and examining bodies in the Faculties of Law, Science, Civil Engineering, 

® Even in 1845, the Council of Education submitted a proposal for the establishment 
of a university in Calcutta. But this proposal did not meet with the approval of the 
Court of Directors in England.

Medicine and Surgery, besides Arts. They were noticeably active in 
promoting collegiate education in different places and at different levels. 
The growth of educational institutions and the studentship between 1860 
and 1892 may be summarized thus:®

The administrative exigencies of the East India Company demanded 
the employment of engineers and doctors for its engineering and medical 
services in subordinate positions, even though on a small scale. For its 
calculated exploitation of the natural resources of India and also for the 
maintenance of its own personnel on the one hand and political as well as 
economic influences on the other, the Company could not but establish the 
minimum number of engineering and medical institutions. 

Engineering and Allied Technical Education 

As has been stated already, Madras possessed a survey school even 
towards the close of the eighteenth century (1794) started by Michael 
Topping, the East India Company’s Astronomer and Geographical Marine 
Surveyor at the Presidency of Fort St. George. The school, which passed 
through vicissitudes from time to time, trained a number of apprentices who 
were taught, in a course extending to IJ year, subjects like algebra, 
mensuration, building-construction, surveying, plan drawings, etc. In 1842 
an attempt was made to establish a college of engineers, and it took 
concrete shape only in 1855 due to the encouragement of A. J. Arbuthnot 
who was Director of Public Instruction in the Madras Presidency. This 
college became the civil engineering college in 1859, and in 1877 was affili- 
ated to the Madras University. From 1880 onwards the college registered 
rapid progress and emerged as one of the best engineering institutions in 
the country. 

As early as 1848, Governor-General Lord Dalhousie suggested that 
each of the three Presidency towns should have an engineering college. 
But it was only in 1856 that an engineering college could be started at

Calcutta, which was aflaiiated a year later to the Calcutta University. For 
some years it was associated with the Presidency College and, in 1880, it 
was shifted to its present quarters at Sibpur near Calcutta. The college, 
which imparted instruction mainly in civil engineering to students mostly 
from Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Burma and Assam, had also a mechanical 
testing laboratory and a mining section. 

In the Bombay Presidency, Elphinstone founded at Bombay in 1821 
an engineering institution which developed later into a college. In 1854 
Poona had an engineering school to provide education for subordinate 
officers of the Public Works Department. The institution which became a 
college in 1856 was later affiliated to the Bombay University. In the 
beginning there was no system of levying tuition fee; instead scholarships 
were awarded with guarantee of appointment for successful candidates. It 
was only in 1870 that tuition fee was levied for the first time. 

It may be noted that the aforesaid engineering institutions offered only 
hcentiateship courses till 1880 when they began to run both degree and 
licenliateship courses. They were well equipped, and on the theoretical side, 
the instruction was stated to be on par with that in England at that time. 

In 1847, after the conclusion of the First Panjab War, steps were taken 
to implement the construction of the Ganges Canal. Some large workshops 
sprang up at Roorkee for that purpose. James Thomason, Lieutenant- 
Governor of North-Western Provinces, proposed the establishment of a 
college to supply trained engineers for the employment in the Upper Ganges 
Canal Project. In 1853 Thomason died, and a year later his name was 
befittingly associated with this college.® In 1864 it was affiliated to the 
Calcutta University. The courses offered at the college were at three 
levels, viz. (i) engineer class; (ii) upper subordinate class and (iii) lower 
subordinate class. The instructions were of a high order and the engineers 
turned out by this college were in great demand. 

Industrial Schools 

In the Presidency of Bombay, a school of industry was established 
early in 1879 at Ratnagiri. Later another came into being in BycuUa. 
Further, there were three other minor industrial schools, while attempts 
were also made to have a network of industrial schools under the Municipal 
Boards. 

At Madras, an industrial school named the School of Ordinance 
Artificers was opened in 1840 by Major Maitland, Superintendent of the 
Gun-carriage Manufactory.*' Yet another institution known as the School 
of Industrial Arts was opened in 1850 by Hunter, a medical man by 
profession, ‘with the liberal and enlightened design of creating among the 
native population a taste for the humanizing culture of the fine arts’. Hunter 
also started another school of industry (1851) ‘in order to afford to the 
rising generation of the country the opportunity and means of acquiring

useful handicrafts*. The two schools were amalgamated under the name of 
School of Industrial Arts which was taken over by the government in 1855. 
In 1886 there were six industrial schools in the Presidency, three in Madras 
and three in the mofussil. The average attendance at the schools in Madras 
was about 60, while the total number of students of the technical schools 
and colleges in that year was less than 1,000, out of a total of about four 
and a half lakhs of students.® 

In 1887 the Victoria Jubilee Technical Institute at Bombay started 
courses in electrical, mechanical and textile engineering. The engineering 
institutions whose number rose to 12 by the end of the nineteenth century 
were supplying qualified men to meet the demands for constructing build- 
ings, roads and canals. In addition, there were some technical schools 
engaged in the training of craftsmen. Needless to add that they were being 
run in such a way as to be in line with the conunercial interests of the British 
Government. 

In Bengal, the Calcutta School of Arts offered courses which were 
comparable with that of any school of art in England; and there were as 
many as 157 students receiving training in 1886. In the North-Western 
Provinces and Oudh, there was practically no school of art worth the name 
even by the close of the nineteenth century. However, there were two 
industrial schools at Gorakhpur and Banaras, a survey school at Calcutta 
(1879) and a school of engineering at Bankipur in Bihar (1896). An in- 
teresting development was the establishment at Dehra Dun of the Imperial 
Forest School in 1878-1881 for the technical training of executive forest 
officers, with the courses extending over 18 to 21 months.^

It must, however, be stated that the government was not blind to the 
importance of technical education for training the requisite number of 
tedbnidans for industrial employment. But the economic policies pursued

by the goverament at that time did not help the flow of capital leading to 
active industrial establishments which could, in turn, employ technicians. 
In 1888 the Government in a resolution stated as follows: ‘Technical edu- 
cation proper is the preparation of man to take part in producing efficiently 
some special article of commercial demand. It is the cultivation of the 
intelligence, ingenuity, taste, observation, and manipulative skill, of those 
employed in industrial production so that they may produce more effici- 
ently. And thus technical education of the special, as contradistinguished 
from the preparatory kind, is an auxiliary of manufacture and industrial 
capital. In India at the present time the application of capital to industry 
has not been developed to the extent which in European countries has 
rendered the establishment of technical schools on a large scale with the 
required success. But the extension of railways, the introduction of mills 
and factories, the exploration of mineral and other products, the expansion 
of external trade, and the enlarged intercourse with foreign markets, ought 
in time to lead to the same results in India as in other countries, and create 
a demand for skilled labour and for educated foremen, supervisors and 
managers. "It may be conceded that the effect of these various influences 
on an Asiatic people is very gradual, and that it would be premature to estab- 
lish technical schools on such a scale as in European countries, and thereby 
aggravate the present difficulties by adding to the educated unemployed a 
new class of professional men for whom there is no commercial demand"^ 
The result of such a policy was that technical and managerial staff of even 
the well-developed industries like cotton, jute and coal consisted of only 
foreign technicians for a fairly long time. 

Medical Education 

Medical education had a humble beginning in the first quarter of the 
nineteenth century. As stated already, the study of indigenous systems of 
medicine was part of the teaching course at the Madrassah (Calcutta) 
and the Sanskrit College (Banaras). In 1822 a ‘Native Medical Institution* 
was established at Calcutta, which offered a three-year course through 
the medium of Urdu. In this institution which had in the beginning about 
twenty students, there used to be only one lecturer who delivered medical 
lessons in the native language. The dissection practised was that of the 
‘inferior animals’. In 1826 the Sanskrit College at Calcutta was running 
medical classes on orthodox lines, using wax models for teaching anatomy, 
and the instruction was in the native language. Even this attempt did 
not last a decade. Another effort made by Elphinstone to have a medical 
institution in Bombay in the same year also ended in a failure after it had 
been in existence for about six years. 

The Bengal Presidency was the first to have had an organized medical 
service. Perhaps, for this reason Calcutta had the honour of having the 
first modem medical college for teaching western medical science through

the medium of English.® In 1833 Lord William Bentinck appointed a 
committee to examine the state of medical education which was being im- 
parted then in Calcutta. The committee recommended the establishment 
of an institution, in which ‘the various branches of medical science cultivated 
in Europe should be taught and as near as possible on the most approved 
European system*. Soon the Native Medical Institution was abolished 
and, as a result, a medical college came into being in 1835 with the main 
object of producing sub-assistant surgeons for employment in military and 
civil stations in India. Dr. M. J. Bramley was appointed as the Superin- 
tendent with Drs. H. H. Goodeve, Nathaniel Wallich and W. B. O’Shaugh- 
nessy on the teaching staff. It was Goodeve who introduced human dis- 
section in the course of studies for the first time in India. Later he also 
arranged for advanced instructions in England for the bright medical 
graduates. 

In the new institution, dissection of human body was undertaken by 
the students. One Madhusudan Gupta was the first to dissect a human 
body in 1836 to the booming of the guns at the Fort William to mark the 
occasion. ‘It had needed some time, some exercise of the persuasive art, 
before Madhusudan could bend up his mind to the attempt; but having 
once taken the resolution, he never flinched nor swerved from it. At the 
appointment hour, scalps in hand, he followed Dr. Goodeve into the 
godown where the body lay ready.’ Apart from dissection, students were 
also taught to observe actually the diagnosis and treatment of diseases in 
the local hospitals. In 1838 a ward with 20 beds and an attached out- 
patients’ department served as the nucleus of the first hospital, and in 1840, 
the first lying-in hospital with 100 beds was constructed in the college 
grounds.*^ 

In March 1844 the first batch of four Indian students (Bhola Nath 
Bose, Gopal Chandra Seal, Dwaraka Nath Bose and Suiji Coomar 
Chuckcrbutty) was sent to England for medical training under the guidance 
of Dr. Goodeve in the University College of London. In 1845 the course 
of instruction was remodelled so as to be within the stipulated conditions of 
the Royal College of Surgeons of England and of the Apothecaries’ Society 
of London. The period of study was also extended to five years. In a 
decade the Medical College received recognition of the Royal College of 
Surgeons of England and the University of London (1846). In 1850 it had 
as many as 8 professorial chairs (anatomy, chemistry, materia medica, 
medical jurisprudence, surgery, medicine, midwifery and ophthalmic 
surgery). In the next year was introduced a three-year course of medical 
training with a view to training subordinate doctors for serving in the dvil 
hospitals and jails. In 1857 the Medical College was aflOiliated to the newly 
established University of Calcutta. Later were added to the college, chairs 
in dentistry (1861) and hygiene (1864). As the institution became oversized, 
the apothecary and the licentiate classes were taken out and a new medical

school started in 1873. In the last quarter of the nineteenth century the 
college was indeed in a flourishing state attracting to its fold students from 
far and wide. What is more, in 1892 the medical degree of the Calcutta 
University was recognized by the General Medical Council of Great Britain.® 



Fig. 10.11. The first four Indian medical graduates who went to London. (Reproduced 
from the Centenary of Medical College^ p. 26.) 

At Madras, a medical school was established in 1843, even though the 
establishment of such a school for the training of the medical apprentices 
of European descent and also of native medical pupils for the military 
subordinate service was sanctioned as early as 1835. In 1846 a chair in 
chemistry and materia medica was added to the school. In 1851 the school 
was raised to the status of a college which in 1855 received recognition 
by the Royal College of Surgeons of London.*' The Medical College, 
which was subsequently affiliated to the Madras University, had two 
sections, the senior one which led to degree level, and the junior one intended 
for the education of apothecaries and licentiates. The Surgeon of the 
General Hospital, Madras, was in charge of the college. In 1846 four 
professorships were sanctioned for anatomy, physiology, midwifery and 
ophthalmology. 

In the Presidency of Bombay, Governor Sir Robert Grant initiated steps 
in 1837 for the establishment of an institution for medical education.*' In 
his honour after his unfortunate death in 1838, sanction was duly accorded

to the establishment of a medical institution, and thus came into being in 
Bombay in 1845 the Grant Medical School to which was accredited the Sir 
Jamshedji Jeejeebhoy Hospital as the ‘School of Practice’. From 1851 
onwards new departments were added to this institution which, in 1854, 
received recognition from the Royal College of Surgeons. Later the institu- 
tion was affiliated to the Bombay University (1860) as a college for training of 
graduates as well as apothecaries. In the last two decades of the nineteenth 
century, the Government adopted liberal policies as a result of which the 
Grant Medical College established itself on sound lines. 

The three medical colleges in the three Presidencies were found in- 
adequate to meet the demand of medical personnel of the times. Steps 
were, therefore, taken for the establishment of 28 medical schools, 'with short 
courses, in different parts of the country such as those at Agra (1853), Nagpur 
(1867), Sealdah (1873), Dindigul and Patna (1874), Nellore (1876), Cuttack 
(1876), Indore (1878), Tanjore (1883), Ludhiana (1894) and Dibrugarh 
(1900).« 

In 1855 was created what was designated as the Countess of Dufferin 
Fund with the avowed object of providing medical education to Indian 
women in a college staffed entirely by women. The effort resulted in the 
establishment of the first medical college for women in 1916, and that was 
in Delhi. 

Agricultural Education 

Agricultural education did not appear to have received sufficient 
attention in the beginning of the nineteenth century, as there did not seem 
to be distinctly separate institutions imparting agricultural education. 
Madras had an agricultural farm (estd. 1854) to which was attached a school 
of agriculture in 1886. The engineering college at Poona (Kirkee), too, 
had an agricultural wing (1879). The importance of agricultural education 
was stressed by the Agricultural Conference held in 1888. A year later 
Dr. J. A. Voelcker, of the British Royal Agricultural Society, made a num- 
ber of suggestions in order to improve upon the agricultural education and 
practices. Even so it was only in 1897 that the government accorded the 
rightful place to agricultural education in the same way as it did for the 
other subjects. 

In the closing decade of the nineteenth century agricultural schools 
were opened in Coimbatore, Nagpur and Kanpur. The Sibpur Engineering 
College also developed an agricultural wing, while the Madras Agricultural 
School soon became a college. However, it was the Bombay University 
which was first to recognize agriculture as a separate subject for degree 
examination. Even so, it was only in 1905 that steps were taken for starting 
an agricultural college at Poona. 

Veterinary science also received its attention. The Indian Cattle 
Plague Commission which was appointed in 1869 made recommendations

leading to the establishment of veterinary colleges at Babugarh (1877), 
Lahore (1882), Bombay (1886), Madras and Calcutta (1893). Towards 
the close of the last century, veterinary services and associated research 
establishments were organized. However, it may be observed in this 
connection that as early as 1799 surgeons trained in the veterinary college 
at London were already in service in India and engaged in the studies 
relating to the breeding of cavalry horses.® 

The Trends 

The following figures give an insight into the turns and trends in the 
field of scientific education in the last two decades of the nineteenth century. 
In 1882 out of 18 professional colleges, there were 12 for law (Bengal lead- 
ing with 7) and only three each for medicine and engineering. In the suc- 
ceeding decade the number of arts colleges rose from 67 to 104 and law 
colleges from 12 to 27, while the number of medical and engineering colleges 
increased each by one only, from three to four (1892-1893). Further, out of 
over 16,000 students in 1892-1893, there were less than 2,000 taking up law, 
800 medical and 500 engineering. 

The after-career of the Indian graduates between 1871 and 1882 can 
be understood by the following figures (based on the Statistical Reports 
for the corresponding years)

It will be observed that, in the course of 10 years, out of over 3,000 
students, hardly nine per cent took to medical and engineering profession. 
The fiist preference was suitable lucrative jobs in government; the next 
was legal profession, equally lucrative.

A CX)NCISB HISTORY OF SOBNCE IN INDIA 


Organizationally also by the end of the nineteenth century the univer- 
sities, five in number, continued to be examining bodies. They were to 
await the Indian Universities Act of 1904 to provide for postgraduate 
teaching and research in both arts and science. Even towards the close of 
the century there was no organized system of technical education in India. 
In effect the attitude of the government towards the promotion of scientific 
and technical education was one of indifference, and at times of direct 
antagonism. 

Towards the close of the nineteenth century there were about 170 
colleges, mostly concentrated in large cities, which did not appear to have 
been established according to a well-conceived plan. There were as many 
as 22 colleges in Calcutta, 14 in Madras and two to three in each of the 
cities hke Allahabad, Nagpur, Dacca, Bombay and Poona. The relation- 
ship between the colleges and the universities did not seem to be as intimate as 
it should have been. It was only the Universities Act of 1904,® which came 
out during the time of Lord Curzon, that sought to bring about a direct 
relationship between them. It was again Curzon who realized the impor- 
tance of technical education in relation to industrial development. Above 
all, science could become a separate study only in the first decade of the 
twentieth century, as indicated later. 

THE NEW LEADERSHIP 

The sustained work of the scientific service organizations on the one 
hand and the growth of scientific education on the other, despite their 
inherent deficiencies and the rather limited spheres of activity, did not fail 
to stimulate the Indian intellectuals, who received scientific training, to 
engage themselves in scientific investigations on their own. As a result, 
the last quarter of the nineteenth century witnessed some Indians who 
came forward either to establish scientific institutions or to conduct 
scientific researches with great zeal and devotion. Even the government 
scientific establishments began to realize the scientific capabilities of the 
Indians. Thus interest in modem science in India assumed a new dimension 
in the last two decades of the nineteenth century. Apart from the well- 
known fields of investigation in the natural sciences, mathematics and 
physical sciences appeared also as enchanting fields of research to the emerg- 
ing university graduates, some of whom made noteworthy contributions 
even in a short time. 

Asutosh Mookerjee 

In the field of mathematics, Asutosh Mookeijee (1864-1924),*' who 
became later the architect of the University of Calcutta, made important 
contributions. Even as a student, at the age of sixteen, he wrote his first 
paper which dealt with a new proof of the 25th proposition of the First 


Orange, pp. 5-6.

Book of Euclid. It appeared in 1881 in the Messenger of Mathematics of 
Cambridge under the title: 'On a Geometrical Theorem*. While a student he 
gave a new method for solving Euler’s equation based on the properties of 
ellipse. Unfortunately he could not find any suitable guide for his researches 
at that time. In 1887 he took up the study of Monge’s differential equation 
to aU conics, and published four papers in that field. His other papers 
included those on isogonal trajectories, hydrodynamics and the determination 
of certain means of elliptic functions. 

Jagadish Chandra Bose 

The first Indian contribution to physics was by Jagadish Chandra 
Bose,® and that was in 1895. As Professor at the Presidency College, 
Calcutta, J. C. Bose’s researches were concerned with electric waves and 
their interaction with matter. 

Bose devised his own instruments with great ingenuity and, with the help 
of them, succeeded in generating waves which had much smaller wavelengths 
(a few millimetres-— from 25 mm to 5 mm). He also investigated the quasi- 
optical properties of these waves, such as refraction, total reflection, polar- 
ization, and rotation of the plane of polarization. His first scientific publica- 
tion entitled ‘On Polarization of Electric Waves by Double Refracting

two dielectric slabs, on total reflection. Yet another investigation of his 
related to the study of the rotation of the plane of polarization. He 
demonstrated that a bundle of twisted jute fibres registered right- or left- 
handed rotation depending upon the right- or left-handed twist of the fibres. 

Bose had a remarkable originality in the design and fabrication of 
apparatus. In 1897 when he was invited to deliver a lecture at the Royal 
Institution in London, he took with him an apparatus— similar to a micro- 
wave spectrometer with transmitter and receiver— constructed by himself 
at Calcutta. In an ingenious way he also constructed models in which 
mechanical or light stimuli could produce electrical responses. In 1900 
he read a paper, ‘On the Similarity in Responses in Inorganic and Living 
Matter’, at the International Congress in Physics at Paris and later at the 
British Association for Advancement of Science at Bradford. His obser- 
vations were met with criticism, and in order to convince his critics, Bose 
worked for two years in the Davy-Faraday Laboratory of the Royal Insti- 
tution. He published eight papers during this period and completed a 
monograph: Response in the Living and Non-living. 

The investigations of Bose showed that not only animal but also 
vegetable tissues under different kinds of stimuli (mechanical, application 
of heat, electric shock, chemicals and drugs) produce similar electric re- 
sponses. He also proceeded to show that similar electric response to 
stimulation could be noticed in certain inorganic systems. 

It is well known that Jagadish Chandra Bose later took up investiga- 
tions on the phenomena of response-behaviour in plants, particularly 
Mimosa pudica, Biophytum sensitivum and Desmodium gyrans (Indian 
Telegraph plant). In 1907 his book Comparative Electrophysiology ap- 
peared. In all his investigations Bose displayed a new spirit and tried 
to offer original interpretations. He even attempted to devise models 
which were illustrative of the physical basis of memory. In recognition 
of his outstanding work, Bose was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society 
in 1920. 

Bose retired as Senior Professor of Physics in 1915 but continued 
to be associated with the Presidency College as Emeritus Professor for 
about two years. In the meantime he raised money from the public for 
the establishment of a research institution. The new institute (called Bose 
Institute) came into being in November 1917 just north of his house on 
the Acharya PrafuUa Chandra Road (formerly Upper Circular Road) in 
Calcutta. He nurtured this institution as its life Director till his death in 
November 1937. In his dedicatory address at the inaugural ceremony of 
the Institute, Bose observed: ‘The advancement of science is the principal 
object of the Institute, and also the diffusion of knowledge. The investi- 
gations to be carried out in the Institute are for the further and fuller in- 
vestigations of the many and ever opening problems of the nascent science 
which includes both Life and Non-life.* 

‘I have sought to associate the advancement of knowledge with the 
widest possible civic and public diffusion of it.’ He then expressed to

Prafulla Chandra Rdy 

In chemistry,® Prafulla Chandra R§y (1861-1944)*' conducted systematic 
chemdal analyses of a number of rare Indian minerals with the object of 
discovering in them some of the missing elements in Mendeleev’s Periodic 
Table. The results, though inconclusive, were published in the Memoirs 
of the Geological Survey of India in 1900. In the course of his analytical 
investigations, P. C. My noticed the formation of mercurous nitrate, a 
compound which was not known then. In 1896 he communicated a pre- 
liminary note on this to the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 

P. C. Ray’s abiding interest in chemistry can be traced to the influence 
of extremely stimulating lectures of Alexander Pedler who was then 
Professor of Chemistry at the Presidency College. In his younger days, 
P. C. Ray saw in chemistry a great potential source for producing materials 
and resources for human benefit on a large scale. He was then 21. He 
appeared at a competitive examination and won the Gilchrist Prize which 
enabled him to go to Edinburgh for further studies. 

In the University of Edinburgh P. C. Ray got the B.Sc. degree in 1885 
and D.Sc. in 1887. The subject of his Doctorial dissertation was ‘Con- 
jugated Sulphates of the Copper-magnesium Group: A Study of Isomor- 
phous Mixtures and Molecular Combinations’. 

On his return to Calcutta in 1888, as it happened, P. C. Ray had to 
struggle hard for a suitable job for a year. During this period he received 
support and encouragement from Jagadish Chandra Bose. In 1889 he 
began his career as Assistant Professor of Chemistry in a temporary capa- 
city in the Presidency College at Calcutta. He was an extremely inspiring 
teacher, lucid and lively in his exposition. P. C. Ray retired as Professor 
of Chemistry from the Presidency College after 27 years of service, and later 
became the Palit Professor of Chemistry at the newly founded University 
College of Science. It was largely owing to his efibrts that the latter insti- 
tuion received the initial stimuli to become one of the centres of active 
chemical research in India. 

P. C. Ray was a meticulous research worker. His researches at the 
Presidency College related to the isolation of mercurous nitrate, alkaline 
earths as well as methyl-ammonium and other alkyl ammonium nitrites. 
In the University College of Science he studied the compounds of metallic 
elements with organic sulphur derivatives, and examined the formation 
and behaviours of some of their simple derivatives. Under his guidance a 
number of students conducted researches on certain double sulphates, 
chemical and physical properties of compounds of zinc, cadmium, mercury, 
and so on. He thus became the founder of what has come to be known 
as the Indian Chemical School

Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science 

In the last quarter of the nineteenth century the importance of science 
as the most fruitful intellectual activity, that it was in the West with its 
profound impact on economic and social life, was being increasingly realized 
by some of the enlightened Indians even. In evidence of this, it may be 
noted that the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science was estab- 
lished by Dr. Mahendra Lai Sircar at Calcutta in 1876. Mahendra Lai 
was a remarkable man who had realized that science was the most powerful 
instrument of modern civilization. He had a brilliant academic record at 
the Calcutta Medical College, having won many a medal and distinction. 
His open-mindedness and aversion to dogmatic approach enabled him to 
advocate homoeopathic system also. A firm believer in the rationality of 
science, Mahendra Lai desired that the Indians should cultivate science on 
their own not only for their economic betterment but also for self-regenera- 
tion. In 1869 in the August issue of the Calcutta Journal of Medicine, 
he wrote an article on the need for a national institution for the cultivation 
of science by the natives of India. Sir Richard Temple, Lieutenant- 
Governor of Bengal, lent his support to his efforts. After six years of 
persuasive hard work and even against some opposition, he collected enough 
funds (a few lacs of rupees raised by prominent citizens of Calcutta and a 
donation of fifty thousand rupees by the Maharaja of Vizianagram) and 
ushered in the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science on 
15 July 1876. 

In its initial stages the Association was intended to be a sort of a 
training school for the diffusion of scientific knowledge. In an eloquent 
address he said: ‘For a variety of reasons the natives of India have long 
ceased to take an active part in the world of intellect ... I would emphati- 
cally say that the Indian youth have shown as much aptitude for, and love 
of science, as the youth of any country in the world . . .’ How true did 
his words reverberate! In the early decades of the present century, the 
Association attracted young research workers including the distinguished 
C. V. Raman. From its earlier phase as teaching institution in sciences, the 
Association began to encourage researches in the physical sciences. Raman, 
who later became Professor of Physics at the Calcutta University, was 
associated with this institution from 1907 to 1933. As a result of his 
researches at the laboratories of the Association, he won international 
recognition, was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (1924) and awarded 
the Nobel Prize in Physics (1930) for his discovery of a new effect, now 
known as the Raman effect, in light scattering (appearance of additional lines 
in the spectrum of light scattered by a substance when illuminated by mono- 
chromatic light). Another eminent physicist K. S. Krishnan, also worked 
there and became the first Mahendra Lai Sircar Professor in 1933. The 
Professorship was created out of a donation of over a lac of rupees 
from Rai Bahadur Behari Lai Mitra, a wealthy citizen of Calcutta. In the 
history of development of modem science in India, the foundation of the

A CX)NCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science is an important land- 
mark; for it heralded the dawn of a national effort for the promotion of 
scientific movement in the country and an involvement of enlightened 
citizens. 

STATE OF INDUSTRY 

While the participation of Indians in the modern scientific investigations 
was clearly noticeable towards the close of the nineteenth century, the 
industry in India presented a sharp contrast. Perhaps a brief reference to 
the state of industry in India during the nineteenth century may not be out 
of place here." In the west there was a constant interaction between 
science-based technology and industry at that time. New industries sprang 
up spectacularly as a result of the applications of science in the leading 
western countries. But in India there was practically no industrial base in 
the modern sense even in the first half of the nineteenth century* The 
East India Company thought it prudent to adopt a policy of complete 
Laissez faire in the field of industry. In its own interest in the cotton 
textiles, the Company even adopted a negative attitude which is too well 
known to merit special mention in this short account. 

It may be noted here that as early as the seventeenth century a.d. India 
enjoyed a leading position in respect of its manufactures including superfine 
textile fabrics, indigo and saltpetre. Gujarat, Coromandel Coast and the 
Indo-Gangetic region were important regions of production. Surat, 
Musalipatam and Hoogly were the noted ports for export of high quality 
goods. However, the commerce in textile products began to show signs 
of decay by the end of the eighteenth century and almost went into oblivion 
by the middle of the nineteenth century. 

Indigo 

In respect of indigo there was a favourable factor, though it was prone 
to be short-lived. The decline of the indigo industry in the West Indies 
at that time acted as a powerful incentive to cultivate indigo on a large 
scale in India. The East India Company brought planters from the West 
Indies, while the required capital was raised from the savings of the Com- 
pany’s public servants. The result was that there was a phenomenal growth 
of indigo-processing factories in Bengal and Bihar by the end of the eight- 
eenth century. In the first half of the nineteenth century Bihar, Banaras 
and the Doab regions emerged as the principal producers of indigo. But 
the industry had to see its end towards the close of the nineteenth century 
as a result of the discovery of the synthetic dye (1856) in England. 

Jute and Cotton 

The jute industry, from its beginnings in 1855 in Serampore (Bengal), 
began to flourish rapidly. In less than 50 years there were some 20 mills 


« The following account is based on the publications of Mehta and Thomas as well as 
the official reports of the industries conoemed. 

36 b 



WESTERN SCIENCE IN INDIA 


563 


owned by the British capitalists with 100,000 looms and over two lakh 
spindles for producing jute goods. When the traditional handloom industry 
of cotton fabrics fell a foul prey to the British Government’s tariff policies, 
the Indian capitalists, particularly the Parsees, embarked upon the modern 
cotton industry. The first cotton mill was established in Bombay in 1853 
with about 25,000 spindles; later another was established at Ahmedabad. 
Within a decade, Bombay and Ahmedabad became industrial centres for 
cotton fabrics (10 in Bombay and 3 in Ahmedabad). In 1890 there were as 
many as 137 mills which mostly produced cotton yarn for export to China 
and Japan. But soon Japan began to compete with India and captured the 
Chinese market. 

Iron and Steel 

The iron and steel industry was indeed in distress. This important 
industry proved a failure practically during the whole of the nineteenth 
century despite the concerted efforts made in this direction. In the Salem 
region® (Madras Presidency) one such effort was made in 1825 by Josaiah 
Marshall Heath, an erstwhile civil servant of the East India Company. 
He resigned from the lucrative job, raised loan from a British firm in 
Calcutta and spent four years in England to get the technical information, 
machinery and a few workmen. By 1830 he had erected the iron-smelting 
works at Porto Novo — two large and two small furnaces — for conversion 
of high grade iron ore (72% iron) into iron, using charcoal of good quality. 
Heath had planned to produce 400 tons of bar iron annually. The quality 
of the bar iron so produced received approbation even in England. In 
the meantime he had exhausted his resources and applied for government 
assistance to the tune of a lac of rupees as well as grant of exclusive rights 
for 25 years. Heath got both ; and the rights granted to him were in fact 
similar to the Parliamentary privileges granted to Messrs. Boulton and 
Watt of England. But in the iron-smelting process using charcoal as the 
reducing agent he experienced difficulties, running as many as twelve un- 
successful trials. Again he was in financial trouble; and the Porto Novo 
works virtually came to an end by the middle of the nineteenth century. 

In Bengal, an ironworks was started at Barakar by a private firm in 
1839, and another near Ranigunj in 1855. Both of them met with failure. 
In 1875 the Bengal Iron Company came into being and, within two years 
of its erection, it began to produce pig iron at Rs.40 per ton as against the 
English pig iron at Rs.60 per ton. But the technological innovations, 
which were taking place in England then, enabled England to sell the pig 
iron at Rs.29 per ton in the very next year. This struck a serious blow to 
the Indian works. In 1882 the government took over the works and 
appointed one Ritter Von Schwarz,*' an Austrian, who had a good deal of 
experience in mining and iron-smelting operations, to examine the works

and submit new proposals. Schwarz prepared a detailed report including 
the plans of operation for about 25,000 tons of finished iron per year. The 
Bengal Iron Company was sold by the government to a private firm in 
1889 when it was named the Bengal Iron & Steel Company. This Company 
was producing about 40,000 tons of iron by 1900; it was not producing 
any steel. 

Coal and others 

Coal-mining, from its small beginnings in 1820, progressed rapidly, 
particularly in the last decade of the nineteenth century, to meet the in- 
creasing demands of the jute and cotton industries, and the railways. 
Among the other industries may be mentioned the tanning industry (flourish- 
ing in Madras, Kanpur and Bombay), paper production (in Bengal, 
Lucknow and Poona) and a chemical works (in Calcutta). The last, known 
as the Bengal Chemical Works, was started in 1900 by Prafulla Chandra 
Ray who pooled all his resources to establish this industry which gradually 
rose to be one of the important chemical manufacturing concerns. But 
India was still without industries for producing sulphuric acid, alkalis and 
other heavy chemicals. These made their appearance only in the twentieth 
century. 


CONCLUDING REMARKS 

While considering the implantation of modern science in India in the 
eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries, a historically important context 
should not go unnoticed. Towards the close of the eighteenth century, 
and practically the whole of the nineteenth century, it was not Britain but 
France and later Germany which led the way in measures for the promotion 
of scientific and technological activities then. It is true that Britain ushered 
in the Industrial Revolution in the middle of the eighteenth century with 
far-reaching effects. The industrial face of Britain became bright and 
gradually the tempo of industrial production increased. The new produc- 
tion units and the townships which grew around them attracted into their 
fold the craftsmen as well as amateurs in large numbers. New associations 
were founded at industrial centres, such as Liverpool, Sheffield and 
Yorkshire. Their numbers were astonishingly on the increase, 10 to 20 
per decade, with the result there were over hundred such societies by the 
end of the nineteenth century covering practically all the important towns. 
The new organizations enabled the scientists and technicians to think 
and work together irrespective of their social positions. More significantly, 
some of them played a substantial role in the ramification of scientific 
education by establishing new universities in their respective localities. 

Apart from these organizations, there also sprang up what were known 
as mechanics’ institutes.® In 1823 London and Glasgow had each a

565 


mechanics’ institute and in 1825, Birmingham. But within a few years, there 
were as many as 600 such institutes which catered to more than a hundred 
thousand apprentices. Practically every town, large or small, had its own 
mechanics’ institute. Nevertheless, these organizations did not appear to 
have in them the necessary potential which could stimulate a vigorous growth 
of modern science in Britain. Illiteracy of the craftsmen and apprentices, 
inadequate financial support, and imbalances in management eventually 
led to the failure of the mechanics’ institutes. Even within a decade of their 
establishment the institutes could not attract mechanics and artisans in 
sufficient numbers for purposes of training. 

While the new organizations were showing signs of withering away, 
the established organizations of repute, like the Royal Society and the 
Royal Institution, seemed to be in no better shape. In the nineteenth 
century it was becoming increasingly apparent that scientific pursuits in 
Britain were on the decline and the State was in no mood to offer 
the much needed support. Humphry Davy even thought of writing on the 
decline of British science, but died before he could complete it. In 1830 
Charles Babbage, Professor of Mathematics at the Cambridge University, 
wrote in his Reflections on the Decline of Science in England that the English 
people were rather indifferent to science and its intellectual possibilities, 
and considered the profession of law more attractive than scientific pursuits. 
He made a vigorous plea for the promotion of science in Britain at a national 
level. 

In 1831 the Yorkshire Literary and Philosophical Society called a 
meeting of the ‘Friends of Science’ where the British Association for the 
Advancement of Science took its birth. The aim of the new organization 
was, as stated under its objectives, ‘ to give a stronger impulse and more 
systematic direction to scientific enquiry, to obtain a greater degree of national 
attention to the objects of science as well as a removal of those disadvantages 
which impede its progress, and to promote the intercourse of the cultivators 
of science with one another and with foreign philosophers’.® 

Further, the scientific and technical education did not register sub- 
stantial progress in Britain even in the nineteenth century. The universities 
seemed to be reluctant to offer specialized courses in sciences. In 1832 
Baden Powell was still exhorting the Oxford University authorities to pay 
more attention to scientific studies. The Cambridge University gave 
encouragement more to mathematical studies than to experimental sciences. 
The London University (the model of the first three Indian universities) was 
no doubt of liberal disposition. Yet in 1858 it was still examining the 
desirability or otherwise of offering specialized science degrees. 

The foregoing historical factors are of considerable importance to the 
understanding of the impact of modern science and technology on India, 
especially in the nineteenth century, in view of India’s direct political, 
economical and educational contacts with Britain, and the policies pursued 


Mason, pp. 35$-60.

by the latter from time to time in these fields. All the same, it is indeed 
refreshing to note that India showed indications of having received a 
substantial impact of western science by the end of the nineteenth century. 

The first two decades of the twentieth century, which inherited the 
impact of the western science, witnessed newer efforts in the direction of 
providing a sound base for modem scientific teaching as well as research in 
India. The role of Governor-General Curzon needs special mention in this 
respect. His Educational Code and the Universities Act of 1904 heralded 
the dawn of unitary and centralized system of education. The universities, 
which were hitherto only the affiliating bodies, not only instituted regular 
inspection of colleges which were affiliated to them but also transformed 
themselves into teaching institutions. The Act declared ‘that the universities 
to be incorporated for the purpose (among others) of making provision 
for the instruction of students, with powers to appoint university professors 
and lecturers, to hold and manage educational endowments, to erect, equip 
and maintain university laboratories and museums, to make regulations 
relating to the residence and conduct of students, and to do all acts, con- 
sistent with the incorporation of this Act, which tend to the promotion of 
study and research’. Immediately after the passing of the Act, it is significant 
to note that the Government of India made a recurring grant of five lacs 
of rupees per annum for a period of five years for the improvement of 
the university and collegiate education. Curzon believed not only in the 
education of the many but also in the co-ordination of the technical educa- 
tion with the industrial development. He even visualized that qualified 
Indian engineers and technical men would in time replace the Europeans 
in the Indian industry. 

In 1902 the Board of Scientific Advice was established with a view to 
co-ordinating the scientific work which was carried out by official agencies. 
The reports of the Board used to be communicated through the Secretary 
of State for India to the Royal Society of London, for advice, though later 
this effort proved ineffective. The Imperial Agricultural Research Institute, 
as stated before, was started in 1903, and the Forest Research Institution 
at Dehra Dun in 1906. In 1911 the Indian Research Fund Association was 
founded by the Government of India for medical research. In the same year 
came into being the Indian Institute of Science at Bangalore (through the 
munificence of J. N. Tata) for advanced scientific research. In addition, 
several specialized scientific societies were in the offing at this time. 

As the multitude of scientific institutions was spread over different 
parts of the vast country, the need arose, as early as 1913, for a periodic 
congressional gathering of scientific workers for exchange of information 
and stimulation of research activities. Thus in January 1914 the first 
session of the Indian Science Congress Association was held under the 
Presidentship of Asutosh Mookeijee at Calcutta in the premises of the Royal 
Asiatic Society of Bengal. Thirty-five scientific papers were discussed in 
six sections (Chemistry, Physics, Geology, 5^ology, Botany and Ethnology), 
and over hundred scientists from different parts of the country were present

at this meeting for the first time. In his Presidential Address Asutosh 
Mookeijee emphasized: ‘Personal association amongst scientific men is 
pregnant with important consequences, not merely by a fruitful exchange 
of ideas. The cultivators of science, by periodical meetings and discussions, 
may bring their aims and views prominently into public notice, and may 
also, whenever necessary, press them upon the attention of the government, 
a contingency by no means remote ; for, as experience has shown, even the 
most enlightened governments occasionally require to be reminded of the 
full extent of the paramount claims of science upon the public funds.’ 

On his part, Asutosh Mookerjee played an effective role in making 
the Calcutta University the first institution to start postgraduate teaching 
and research in 1916. Asa result of his efforts, some leading wealthy men 
of Bengal came forward with large endowments for this purpose. By 1919 
the Calcutta University had postgraduate classes in physics and applied 
physics, chemistry, applied mathematics and experimental physiology. 
Undoubtedly, in the beginning of this century the modem science entered 
on a new stage in India and began to grow rapidly in the succeeding years. 




RESUME 

B. V. SUBBARAYAPPA 


In the preceding chapters a concise account has been given of the 
various branches of science as they developed in India in the ancient 
and medieval periods, and also of the growth of western science in India 
up to the end of the nineteenth century a.d. The treatment has been 
subjectwise, and each subject has been dealt with in a broad chronological 
setting. 

In this r^sum^ an attempt has been made to highlight some important 
aspects and achievements of Indian science in the pre- and protohistoric, 
Vedic and post-Vedic periods, the Classical Age and after up to c. a.d. 
1200, the medieval and the modern periods. Chapter and page numbers 
are given in bold and ordinary types respectively in brackets, wherever 
necessary, to indicate the portions or sections to be referred to for further 
details. A chronological chart depicting the major scientific and techno- 
logical texts and developments up to the end of the nineteenth century a.d. 
is also appended. 

The great subcontinent of Asia, which in area is nearly equal to that of 
Europe with the exception of Russia and which goes under the name of 
Bharatavarsa^ or India, ^ has played a distinct role in the history of techno- 
logy and science. Geologically it is believed that during the Mesozoic era 
(about 230 million years ago) a great part of the now known Himalayan 
region was beneath the sea (called the Tethys sea), while the peninsula, 
possibly with the exception of the coastal area, must have been a land at 
least since the Permo-Carboniferous period (over 300 million years ago). The 
gradual uplift of the Himalayas is supposed to have occurred mainly in 
Eocene-Oligocene (about 30 to 40 million years ago), and the final phase of 
the mountain elevation in the Pleistocene periods. The principal features

of this subcontinent had assumed more or less the present shape and topo- 
graphy possibly by the early Pleistocene time (about one to two million 
years ago), save, in front of the newly elevated mountain ranges, the region 
which formed almost a longitudinal depression or a foredeep corresponding 
to the high mountainous terrain. It has been conjectured that this depres- 
sion got filled up by alluvial and wind-blown deposits, and became the 
plains fit enough for habitation geologically not very long ago.® Known 
as the Indo-Gangetic plains because of flow of many a river belonging to 
the Indus-Ganges system, the plains are reputed for their fertility and 
effective manoeuvrability for agricultural operations, and have been the 
home, from time to time, of a number of different groups of people who 
developed their agriculture, arts, crafts and industries. There has been yet 
another fertile alluvial tract covering the region of modern Gujarat and 
Kathiawar formed by the river and estuarine depositions, which also wit- 
nessed the growth of advanced human settlements. In contradistinction to 
these alluvial formations which geologically are not old enough, is the much 
older laterite rocky terrain of the peninsula comparatively less fertile than 
the northern plains, and here also is found evidence of early human in- 
habitants some of whom belonged to the neolithic and chalcolithic stages. It 
should be noted that the natural environments provided by these geological 
features of the subcontinent and not inconsiderably the latter’s geographical 
position with reference to the other culture-areas of the then known world 
have been not only stimulative to, but also determinative of, the endeavours 
of man the maker and man the thinker in this part of the globe. 

As to the early man who wandered on this subcontinent there is little 
or no information, for no skeletal remains of the palaeolithic man have been 
unearthed so far in this region. Anthropologists believe that the terrain 
now known as the Siwaliks (a later phase of the Himalayan elevation) might 
have been the home of early man in India. In any case, in this area have 
been discovered some stone-tools which indicate a chopper-chopping tool 
culture in existence there perhaps over 150,000 years ago. That the early 
human had been active and groups of men existed in different parts of the 
subcontinent have been evidenced by some types of stone-tools found in 
the Punjab, Peninsular India, Kashmir, Bengal, etc. The Middle Palaeo- 
lithic Age in India corresponds to c. 25000 b.c. and the Late Stone Age to 
c. 5000 B.c. The neolithic culture which is characterized by some kind of 
habitation and agricultural practices leading to production of food has been 
noticed in the regions of Andhra, Karnatak and Kashmir even as late as 
c. 2000 B.C., while in some other parts of India like Rajaputana, Central 
India, the Deccan, etc., the chalcolithic culture has also been found in the 
period 1800 B.c.** However, earlier still in the region covering Sind, the 
Punjab, Rajaputana, Saurashtra and Baluchistan, there flourished a civili- 
zation (c. 2300-1750 B.c.) which was by far the largest of the world’s three 
most ancient civilizations, covering an area of roughly 840,000 square miles.

festations have occurred in different periods and in different parts of the 
land, not always in the recognized sequence. 


PRE- AND PROTOHISTORIC PERIOD 

The neolithic man in India, apart from his primitive attempts at agri- 
culture of which we have but scanty information,® was quite familiar with 
certain plants and animals which were part of his environment. His prac- 
tical knowledge of animals has been handed over to us in the form of what 
are called ‘haematite drawings’ in the caves or sheltered rocks. Such 
drawings have been found on the rocky walls of the Vindhya hills in Mirza- 
pur district (depicting hunters attacking a rhinoceros with barbed spears), 
in the caves of Hoshangabad district (portraying a giraffe), of the Kaimur 
hills (showing stag-hunts), and at Singanpur (representing an animal resem- 
bling a kangaroo, also horse and deer). It would seem that rhinoceros was 
then more widely distributed in India than at present. The neolithic potter 
was able to produce earthen vessels (generally globular with round bases 
and flair slips) which were hand-made, the potter’s wheel obviously being 
unknown to him in the initial stages, as evidenced by the finds in the pre- 
historic rock shelters of Mirzapur, Laghnaj, Nagarjunakonda, Birbanpur, 
Burzahom and certain sites in the southern Deccan. Later he was able to 
devise the wheel and produce the wheel-thrown pottery, the specimens of 
which have been found in some of the neolithic settlements in south India. 

The Harappan Culture 

In India the history of technology and science begins naturally with the 
Indus valley civilization which is often referred to as the Harappan Culture, 
Harappa along with Mohenjo-daro being the important sites of archae- 
ological value in the Indus valley. The Harappan culture had established 
commercial links with the neighbouring cultures in the central and western 
Asian regions. It is interesting to note that some Harappan seals have 
been found in the Lower Mesopotamia. There seemed to be brisk com- 
mercial relations between the Harappan culture and that of Mesopotamia 
at the time when the former was in a flourishing state. The archaeological 
evidence at Lothal indicates that there was sea-borne trade too. Some of 
the ceramic appearances, seals, amulets and ornamental forms found in the 
Harappan settlements, on closer analysis, are noticed to have their parallels 
in the Mesopotamian cultures. Even the religious belief like the worship 
of the Mother-goddess representing a fertility cult which was in vogue in 
the Harappan urban civilization was more or less similar to that practised 
in the early Sumerian village-cultures. Not a few of the animal motifs

vutgare-con^ctum) in the chalcolithic sites of Navdatoli and Maheswar.

found on the Harappan seals are in common with those of Syria and Crete.® 
There is no denying the fact that there was a movement of ideas and tech- 
niques among the diverse culture-areas in the third and the second millen- 
nium B.C., and that the Harappan culture lay on the periphery of the already 
well-established central and western Asian cultures. 

Be that as it may, the Harappan culture displayed certain original 
characteristics and underwent its own civilizational experiences. The over- 
all picture of this culture appears to be that it had a reasonable agricultural 
surplus and a farming economy, developed a way of settled life and material 
culture enriched by many a craft and industry. The craft of potting had 
registered a technological progress. The Harappan pottery was mainly 
wheel-made, turned in various shapes and sizes out of the well-levigated 
alluvium of the Indus. The unearthed pottery specimens with a number 
of designs and colour combinations throw light on the fact that the pro- 
duction technique was standardized to a high degree. The Harappan 
potters also knew the art of glazing and it would appear that the glazed 
pottery found at Mohenjo-daro was probably the earliest specimen of its 
type. Metalsmiths were well versed in the techniques of making beads, 
sheet-making, ri vetting, coiling and casting. The bronze figurine discovered 
at Mohenjo-daro was probably cast by the cire-perdue process. A number 
of metallic tools, mostly of copper and bronze, found in this area reveal 
that the Harappan metalsmiths had sound knowledge of cold-working and 
annealing of the metal. Of the tools, a special word needs to be said 
about a true saw which has the teeth and the adjoining part of the blade set 
alternatively from side to side, for a similar type of saw was unknown else- 
where until Roman times (5, pp. 275-83). Apart from metal-working, 
the Harappans knew the use of a number of minerals for ornamental, cos- 
metic and medicinal purposes. They had developed social sanitation and 
public hygiene to a high level as borne out by the town-planning, paved 
streets, water-supply, public baths and hydropathic establishments, dis- 
charge and drainage systems, etc,, in their urban living. They also knew 
spinning and weaving and were well known for the burnt-brick -and-mor tar 
constructions. Doubtless they had evolved a system of measurement and 
computational techniques which were necessary for not only constructions 
but also commercial transactions. 

The animal representations on the Harappan pottery, seals, figurines 
and toys give an insight into their familiarity with and domestication of 
animals. Some 92 species of animals have been identified and of them 
mammals (41), molluscs, marine and land forms (31), reptiles (12), fishes (5) 
and birds (2) are notable. The domestic animals included the humped cattle, 
buffalo, ass, sheep, goat, elephant, camel, pig, dog and cat. The wild life 
comprised, among others, elephant, tiger, rhinoceros, wolf, jackal and chital, 
but no lion. A large number of seals depict a curious legendary animal 
called the unicorn, a male beast with one horn, a heavily built body of an

antelope or an ox with a long tuffed tail. The widely used domestic animal 
was the bull, and although the figure of cow is not represented on any of 
the seals, it was an important domestic animal (8, pp. 404-16). 

The Harappans had attained a reasonably good level of agricultural 
practices; yet the plough was not in use. Likewise, of the metals, iron 
was unknown to the people of the Indus valley; and of the animals, horse 
was probably not in use then. The plough, iron and the horse of a superior 
breed began to be used in India by a new set of people of a new social 
order, whose thoughts and practices have come down to us in the form of 
several literary compositions known as the Vedas, Brdhmams, Aranyakas 
and the Upanisads. 


VEDIC PERIOD 

This new set of people, sometimes referred to as the Aryans, made 
notable contributions to the development of science and technology in 
India, and from about the fifteenth century b.c. to about the eleventh or 
twelfth century a.d., the history of science in India is, by and large, that of 
their thoughts and religious practices, of their arts and crafts which took 
into their fold not a few of the locally existing thoughts and techniques 
which they encountered, reshaped and assimilated. 

Rta 

Of the principal Vedic thoughts which are of relevance to us, mention 
should be made of the natural law (rta) which finds adequate expression in 
the Rgveda. The Vedic seers conceived of this law as the real governing 
force of the universe and even the Vedic gods are considered to be either 
under the operation of this law or its guardians. The natural phenomena 
like the flow of rivers, occurrence of night and dawn, are explained in terms 
of this natural law. It is now known that there was among the Baby- 
lonians® a conception of natural law with reference to divinity. Among the 
Greek thinkers, Heraclitus (c. sixth century b.c.), Democritus (c. fifth 
century b.c.), Plato (427-347 b.c.) and Aristotle (384-322 B.c.) are known 
to have given expression to the idea of natural law. A fact of great signi- 
ficance is that the importance given to and the role of rta in the movements 
governing the human world and the cosmic universe alike, as depicted in 
the Rgveda and the later Vedic literature, point out that the Vedic people 
had an instinctive conviction in the natural order— a conviction which is of 
prime importance for sustenance of scientific attitude (9, pp. 453-55). 

PaHcabhutas 

Another doctrine which gradually took shape out of certain speculative 
layers of the ^tgvedic thought and the early Upanisads is the one concerning 


Needham, II. pp. 533 ff.

the pancabhutas. Wholistic in nature, the fivefold character of the panca- 
bhutas, viz. prthvi, ap, tejas, vdyu and dkdsa, aimed at a coherent explanation 
of the apparently unordered and seemingly diverse world of matter, quali- 
ties and motion. It was tacitly assumed that the five bhutas to which 
belonged all the subtle and the gross, the perceptibles and the imperceptibles, 
and the limited and the unlimited, provided a base for rational interpretation 
of the problem of matter. With such wide application, the doctrine of 
the pancabhutas was able, as no other could, to permeate practically all the 
departments of Indian thinking and to become, as it did, an integrated 
component of the major philosophical systems. The Sdmkhya, Nydya and 
the Vaisesika have laid a special emphasis on the pancabhutas, while the 
Jaina, Bauddha and Carvaka recognize the first four bhutas. Special 
mention should be made of the Sdmkhya which in addition enumerates 
the five tanmdtras or the subtile states corresponding to the five bhutas. 
Perhaps the tanmdtras were conceived so as to share the characteristics of 
both mind and matter. It is interesting to note that in the west the doctrine 
of five elements— earth, water, air, fire and ether— also played an important 
role in the Aristotelian interpretation of the universe and attracted the 
attention of thinkers in Europe as well as in West Asia for a long time. 
Nevertheless, the way in which the pahcabhuta doctrine became intertwined 
not only with the general inquiry into the intelligible reality but also with the 
notions concerning the human body merits special attention. It may be 
emphasized that the Indian classical medical texts are indeed one in describ- 
ing the interplay of the five bhutas in the organic as well as inorganic world. 
Human body is regarded as a combination of the bhutas and of soul. In the 
Susruta Samhitd there is an integrated exposition of the way in which the 
five bhutas shape the human body from its very conception. The food- 
stuffs and other substances are classified in terms of the five bhutas, as also 
the six rasas which, according to the classical medical texts, play an impor- 
tant role in the physiological processes. Such, then, was the viability of 
the doctrine of the pancabhutas, a proper understanding of which is ab- 
solutely essential for obtaining an insight into various facets of science in 
India (9, pp. 455-61). 

Vedic Astronomy 

In the Rgveda are found certain symbolic hymns and references which 
throw ample light on the astronomical ideas of the Vedic Indians. Keen 
observers as they indeed were, the Vedic priests possessed adequate knowl- 
edge of the course of the sun, the path and phases of the moon, the bright 
wandering objects or the planets, the starry firmament, occurrences of 
eclipses and the like. Their intuitive minds developed a thought-pattern 
concerning the motion of the astronomical bodies. The moon became the 
obvious choice for determining the month and, in fact, the moon was 
referred to as mdsakrta (maker of month) similar to the modern word, 
month, being derived from the word ‘mooneth’. There were two systems of 



574 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


reckoning—the amanta and the purnimdnta. The Rgveda refers to a number 
of mk^atras (asterisms) as well as the course of the moon through them. 
The names of the lunar months were after those of the naksatras in which 
the full moon occurred. Known as ‘lunar mansions’, the naksatra system 
seems to be characteristically Indian. For, according to Max Muller, ‘the 
Babylonian Zodiac was solar and, in spite of repeated researches, no trace 
of a lunar Zodiac has been found, where so many things have been found, 
in the cuneiform inscriptions. But supposing even that a lunar Zodiac has 
been discovered in Babylon, no one acquainted with the Vedic literature, 
and with the ancient Vedic ceremonial, would allow himself to be persuaded 
that the Hindus borrowed that simple division of the sky from the Baby- 
lonians’." It must, however, be noted that there is some sort of an agree- 
ment*' between the naksatras and the Chinese hsius^ 28 in number, which 
were named after constellations with determinant stars. The Arabian 
manazils, again 28 in number, correspond, by and large, to the naksatras-, 
and as many as 19 manazils are in agreement with the corresponding 
naksatras. But as a lunar Zodiac, the Chinese system appeared later 
(c. second century b.c.) and later still the Arabian manazils. The 
Indian naksatras are 27 or 28 in number^ (the Atharvaveda mentions 28 
naksatras) and in each naksatra, the brightest star is referred to yoga-tar a — 
a star connected with the first point on the ecliptic of the division or near it, 
north or south, but always being capable of occultated by the moon or in 
conjunction with the moon or planets. In effect, the yoga-tdrds furnished 
the Vedic priests with the necessary means of observation (2, pp. 66-72). 

The priests whose reputation and survival in the Vedic society depended 
upon the performance of sacrificial rites at auspicious times had developed 
calendars which were luni-solar. In other words, they used the naksatras 
also to follow the motions of the sun, although they did not map the sky 
by the heliacal risings or settings of certain stars in the same way as the 
Babylonian or the Egyptian star-gazers did. Even so they were able to 
co-relate the motions of the moon and the sun in their own way. In course 
of time, a method of intercalation came into vogue and an additional 
month of 30 days (subsequently 25 or 26 days a month) was added at the 
end of a specific period, normally five years, for luni-solar adjustments. 
The length of the five-year period (5x360 = 1,800 days) was thus made up 
to 1,830, 1,825 or 1,826 (modern figure 1,826J days) (2, pp. 75-76). The 
lunar day, tithi, is again peculiar to Indian astronomy. The lunar month 
was divided into two pak^as of 15 tithis each. The 30 tithis of the lunar 
month were found to overrun the days of the actual lunar month of 27 


« Max MiUlcr, p. 126. 

^ Nine of the Indian naksatras agree with the corresponding hsius both in respect of the 
determinant stars and the number of stars associated with the constellations ; for eleven 
nakfatras, the determinants are different though they belong to the same constellations ; 
for the remaining nakfatras the determinants are selected from different constellations.

assigned in the ecliptic.

or 28 days. ‘They were probably introduced merely to establish some 
sort of harmony between the revolutions of the sun and the moon, and to 
help trace the path of the moon through the naksatras. But since the 
apparent velocity of the moon (and hence the lunar day) is not uniform, 
the tithis were purely spatial abstractions.*® 

Another important aspect of the Vedic astronomy is the concept of a 
cosmic cycle associated with the cosmic creative spirit. According to the 
^atapatha Brahmana, Prajapati’s year consists of 10,800 moments. It 
would seem that this figure was derived from the 12 months, 30 nychthe- 
mera of each month and 30 moments of each nychthemeran (i.e. 12x30x 
30 = 10,800). The Rgveda has 10,800 metrical divisions of 40 syllables 
each, thus giving a figure of 432,000 (10,800 x 40) syllables. This figure of 
432,000 gave rise to an important astronomical period in the Siddhantic 
astronomy later in India, in terms of a mahdyuga of 12,000 divine year 
being equivalent to 360 solar years (12,000 x 360 = 4,320,000 years). It is 
interesting to note that in about the fifth century b.c. Herachtus alluded 
to a Great Year of 10,800 years and Berossos, the Babylonian astronomer, 
spoke of a cosmic cycle of 432,000 years. ‘These figures first appeared in 
India long after the Satapatha Brdhmam was written, and although Greek 
and Babylonian astronomers were not otherwise greatly influenced by 
Indian ideas, they must have been in this respect.’^ 

Vedic Mathematics 

The mathematical knowledge in the Vedic period seemed to be of a 
high order. That the numbers and their reckoning had a special appeal is 
clear from the fact that the Yajurveda has names of numbers even up to 
10^2 and the Pahcavimsa Brahmana gives an account of numbers in ascend- 
ing decimal scale. It is interesting to note that the highest terminology of 
the Greeks (which probably came into use by about the fourth century b.c.) 
was myriad (10*) and of the Romans was mille which denoted just a thousand 
(10^) only. It may be added that in some of the later Jaina and the Bauddha 
literature is found terminology to express numbers as large as and 
(3, pp. 14(M1). 

A proper scientific vocabulary of number names was also developed 
so as to be permissive of operations including addition, subtraction and 
multiplication. Fundamental arithmetical operations involving elementary 
fractions were also known, as evidenced by the occurrence of such names, 
as ardha (i), tripada (f) in the Rgveda, and pdda (i), hpha (J), kusfha (j\) 
and kald (y’^) in the Maitrdyani Sarphitd, Arrisa and bhaga denoting frac- 
tions in general occur in the Sulba-sutras (3, pp. 143-44). In the field of 
geometry, the SuM-sutras (Rules of the Thread or Measuring Chord), 
which as part of the Kalpa-sutras deal with sacrificial altar-constructions 
(citi) using a definite number of bricks of fixed dimensions, deserve special

attention. Of them, mention may be made of Baudhayana, Vddhula, 
Apastamba, Hiranyakem, Manava, Vdraha and Kdtydyana. They deal 
with positions and spatial magnitudes with reference to the construction 
of geometrical forms on which the sacrificial fires had to be raised. 
The other geometrical notions found in them include the construction 
of squares and rectangles, relation of the diagonal to the sides, and 
equivalent rectangles and squares. Both Apastamba and Baudhayana 
describe a square equal to the sum of two different squares like 32-I-42 = 52 ; 
52+122 = 132; 82.^152 = 172. 72_|.242 = 252; 122+252 = 372, etc. It is 
well known that according to the theorem attributed to Pythagoras (c. fifth 
century b.c.) ‘ the transverse chord of a rectangle produces (by the con- 
struction of) a square on itself, what the length and the breadth produce 
separately’. According to the ^ulba^sutras the diagonal of a rectangle 
produces by itself both (the areas) produced separately by its two sides. No 
wonder then some western scholars share the view that the origin of the 
Pythogorean theorem can be traced to the Indian !§ulba~sutras. 

Another notable aspect of the Vedic mathematics is the way in which 
the values of such irrational numbers as J 2 and are given to a high 
degree of approximation, although the method by which these values are 
arrived at has not been indicated in the hlba texts. Yet another relates to 
permutations and combinations. The Vedic meters with syllables such as 
6, 8, 9, 11, 12 and so on were formed by permutations and combinations of 
syllables by changing the long (guru) and short (laghu) sounds within each 
syllable group. The triangular array formed by the bionomial coefficients 
(referred to as Pascal’s triangle which appeared in Europe not before the 
sixteenth century a.d.) was known in India in the form of meruprastdra, a 
pyramidal expansion of the number of combinations of 1, 2, etc., syllables 
formed of short and long sounds. This was dealt with later in a method- 
ical way by Pingala (c. third century b.c.) in his Chandah-sutro, and was 
further extended to a binomial theorem (a-fZ?)" by Halayudha in the 
eleventh century a.d.® 

Medical Knowledge 

As to the medical knowledge of the Vedic Indians, the samhitds refer 
to a number of ailments affecting the head, eyes, ear, heart, lungs, stomach, 
skin, rheumatism, etc. Diseases are said to be caused by congenital factors, 
change of seasons and minute organisms in the body. There is, however, 
no attempt to classify the diseases based on some principle. No doubt the 
magical procedures, charms and imprecations, chanting of mantras and 
other rituals were part of the general treatment of diseases. But a large 
number of plant remedies were known and some minerals and animal 
products were also used as healing agents. The Vedic physiology was 
based upon the concept of prdna (breath) which was supposed to be the

sustainer of life. Nosology was, by and large, descriptive in approach and 
etiology was noted for its absence. The anatomical and physiological 
facts, though found considerable in the Vedic texts, appear to be without 
any rational classification. Nevertheless, the Vedic medical vocabulary 
speaks of their careful observation of the human body and its ailments, 
and these paved the way for codification of knowledge later as found in the 
Ayurveda which is regarded as a part {updnga) of the Atharvaveda, 

Knowledge of Plants and Animals 

There is ample literary evidence to show that the Vedic Indians pos- 
sessed considerable knowledge of the morphology and internal strypture of 
plants. And they were able to distinguish and name the different parts of 
plant— root, shoot, stem, leaves, twigs, flowers and fruits. They knew the 
difference between the tvac or valkala (skin) and the inner sdra (nutrient 
fluid). Plants were divided broadly into three groups— (tree), osadhi 
(herb) and vlrudh (creeper). The Atharvaveda subdivides the herbs into 
seven types based on their morphological and other characteristics (7, 
pp. 376-78). 

Of the animals, there are over 260 names used in the Vedic literature, 
denoting mammals, birds, some reptiles, fishes and insects. The Atharva- 
veda gives an account of 16 types of kfmis which are poisonous and causa- 
tive of diseases in cattle and man. The domestic animals included the cow, 
bull, buffalo, elephant, horse, sheep, goat, dog and cat. As to the wild 
animals, lion was known to the Vedic Indians. 

P,G. Ware 

In respect of the material culture and technological practices of the 
Vedic period, a special significance attaches to the advent of the Painted 
Grey ware and iron. The Indo-Aryans, according to some scholars, devel- 
oped and used a de luxe type of pottery now christened by the archaeo- 
logists as the Painted Grey ware. It has been surmized that the Indo- Aryan 
settlers on the Indo-Gangetic plains possessed a knowledge of some similar 
ceramic used in parts of Iran, Sistan, etc. (c. second millennium B.c.), and, 
utilizing the locally existing ceramic techniques, they evolved the appropriate 
baking conditions for the production of the Painted Grey ware. This ware, 
first noticed at Ahicchatra and belonging to a date range of c. 1000-400 
B.C., has, by and large, an extensive western distribution. A point worthy 
of note is that a number of iron objects have been discovered in association 
with the later phase of this ware in several excavated sites (5, pp. 285-87). 

Iron 


Though there are no details of the iron metallurgical practices in the 
Vedic literature, it is reasonable to suppose that the small furnaces em- 
ployed for the extraction of iron might well have been of an open hearth 
37

type. The word ayas used generally for the metals like copper or bronze 
began to acquire the connotation of iron as noticed in the later Vedic texts. 
On the basis of the archaeological evidence it seems to be fairly certain 
that iron was introduced into India by c. lOOQ-800 b.c. A charcoal sample 
from an early level of Atranjikhera II (where some iron objects were found) 
gives a radiocarbon date of 1025 ± 1 10 b.c. At Hastinapur have been found 
a couple of slags of iron in the later levels of the Painted Grey ware 
horizon, indicating local iron-smelting operations as early as c. 1100-800 
B.C. It may be mentioned that the earliest smelting operations of iron 
can be dated as far back as the second millennium b.c. in the region 
of Asia Minor and Caucasus, and there was by the end of the second 
millennium b.c. an appreciably large use of iron in the Near East whence 
the Indian iron metal-workers possibly derived their technical knowledge. 
But the fact of significance is that within the next five to six centuries 
of the advent of iron in India, the technical proficiency reached was so 
high that the Indian iron and steel objects earned the admiration of the 
western world (5, pp. 287-90). 

Agriculture 

In the Vedic period agriculture was an important vocation and not a 
few of the then social and religious customs were associated with the agri- 
cultural operations of ploughing, sowing, reaping and threshing. The 
plough, sickle, sieve and the contrivance for winnowing were among the 
agricultural implements. Of the important grains grown in this period, viz. 
wheat, rice and barley, significantly enough the ^gveda does not mention 
rice at all indicating that rice was a wild growth and not yet cultivated in 
the early period of the Indo-Aryan settlement. The Yajurveda and the 
Atharvaveda contain references to rice of different varieties as well as to 
several agricultural operations. The Vedic farmers are credited with the 
practice of improving the fertility of the soil by the method of rotation 
fallowing and this system appears to have been followed in the west at a later 
date, according to Roxburgh, the Father of Indian botany (6, pp. 352-54). 

POST-VEDIC PERIOD 

Ayurveda 

In the post-Vedic period, the Ayurveda as a rational assemblage of 
methodical concepts and systematic therapeutic practices occupies an 
honoured position. Even though the celebrated classical texts of the 
Ayurveda, viz. the Caraka and Suiruta Samhitas, which have come down 
to us, took their present form probably in the early centuries of the Christian 
era, the thoughts and practices enshrined in them were doubtless in vogue 
from about the seventh or sixth century b.c. The prime object of the 
Ayurveda is the preservation of human life, of animals and even of plants. 
In man, life is the manifestation of body, senses and the spirit according to 

37B 



R&UME 


579 


Ayurveda, In its doctrinaire approach, this science of life owes a great 
deal to the philosophies of the Sdmkhya, Yoga and the Vaiie^ika adopting 
the Vaisesika principles in so far as the dravya-guna vijfidnay the tridosa 
theory and the saptadhdtus are concerned, and the Sdrfikhya principles 
relating to the paHcabhautika body and its evolution from puru^a-prakfti. 
As has been noticed, the Ayurveda believes that the world consisting of the 
inorganic as well as the organic (sthdvarajangamarupa) is formed out of the 
pahcabhutas. The entire gamut of substances used for medicinal purposes 
are referred to, broadly, as dka^iyadravya^ vdyavlyadravya, taijasadravya, 
apyadravya and parthivadravya. The Ayurveda deals with the science of 
medicine in terms of eight divisions (as(dngas\ viz. ^alya (surgery), Makya 
(treatment of diseases of E.N.T.), kdyacikitsd (internal medicine), bhuta- 
vidyd (treatment of supernatural diseases), kaumdrabhrtya (paediatrics), 
agada (toxicology), rasdyana (rejuvenation) and vdjlkarana (virilification). 
Of the two most important classical texts of the Ayurveda (4, pp. 224-27), 
the Caraka Samhitd gives importance to internal medicine and the Su^ruta 
Samhitd accords a special position to surgery. 

Central to the diagnosis as well as treatment of diseases, according to 
the Ayurveda, is the doctrine of tridosas — vdta, pitta and kapha. They are 
referred to as tridhatus when they are in their normal states, supporting the 
bodily functions; and they become tridosas or vitiating agencies if they are 
deranged or in a state of imbalance. Though rakta (blood) is not included 
as the fourth factor or agency, the Ayurveda recognizes the role of rakta 
along with the tridhdtus in the maintenance of the bodily functions. The 
tridhatus are recognized in terms of the five elements thus: dkd§aA-ydyu~> 
vdta\ agrii-> pitta; and ap-\-p(thvl-^ kapha. The tridosas are believed 
to be all pervasive in the body, though certain areas as cardinal seats for 
each of them have been recognized. Each of the tridosas is thought of in 
terms of five functional aspects, vdta\ prana (governing respiration), udana 
(for uttering sounds and speech), samdna (separation of digested juice), 
vydna (carrying the bodily fluids) and apdna (expelling faeces, urine, etc.); 
pitta: pdcaka (aiding digestion and imparting heat), rahjaka (imparting red- 
ness to the chyle so that it could become blood), sadhaka (increasing brain 
power), alocaka (aiding vision) and bhrdjaka (improving complexion); and 
kapha: kledaka (moistening food), avalambaka (imparting energy and 
strength), bodhaka (tasting), tarpaka (governing the functions of eye and 
other sensory organs) and Me^maka (lubricating). The foregoing methodi- 
cal conceptual scheme is a characteristic of the Indian system of medicine. 

Of the other characteristic concepts of the Ayurveda, those concerning 
rasa, gum, vlrya, vipdka and prabhdva deserve special mention, for the 
Ayurveda holds that every substance, animal, vegetable or mineral, is a 
repository of these five attributes. Rasas are six in number (madhura, 
amla, lavana, kafu, tikta and ka^dya). There is a detailed account of the 
properties and effects of each of these rasas in the Ayurvedic classics, as the 
knowledge of the rasas is considered as essential for therapeutics. The 
term gum refers to idririka gunas, twenty in number such as guru, laghu,

Sara, sthira, sandra and drava. Substances are taken in for the growth as 
well as maintenance of the body in the context of these gunas, Virya has 
been recognized generally as of two kinds, u^na and ilta, and as causative 
of certain manifestations such as cheerfulness, strength, thirst, giddiness, 
etc. Vipdka may be understood as the biochemical processing of food, 
while prabhdva represents the over-all effect on the body and mind. 

The theoretical basis for the way in which the food gets digested and 
assimilated into the body is again the doctrine of the paflcabhutas. The 
agency which brings about the transformation of the food into the rasas is 
referred to as jathardgni which means literally ‘fire in the stomach’, but 
connotes a wealth of meaning inclusive of all digestive processes in the 
stomach as well as in the intestines. The word agni is significant, for it 
actually cooks (pdka) and cooks specially (vipdka) the food for absorption 
by the bodily tissues. The chyle or rasa, in its sojourn in the body, gets 
transformed into rakta (blood), mdmsa (muscle), medas (fat), asthi (bone), 
majjd (marrow) and hkra (semen) in the order stated. The rasa and the 
aforesaid six are known as saptadhdtus which maintain the body. At each 
stage of transformation, the causative agent is called dhdtvagni. Each 
dhdtu has three manifestations, viz. sthiila (gross), suksma (fine) and kitfa 
(refuse). The first is in the nature of the concerned dhdtu and the second 
passes on potentially the character of the succeeding dhdtu. According to 
the Ayurveda the principal seat of rasa is heart, and the fluid moves on 
through 24 tubular vessels called dhamams. Besides dhamanis, there are 
also ^irds (small vessels which do not pulsate) and srotas (minute vessels 
which lie in between smaller dhamanis and iirds). 

Treatment in Ayurveda is a two-way process: elimination of deleteri- 
ous ingredients and replenishment with the harmonious ones, so that 
the tridosas become tridhdtus again. All drugs, therapeutic procedures and 
even surgery are employed towards this end. Among the specific thera- 
peutic measures are cleansing accumulated bodily wastes, internal as well 
as external medication; use of eye-drops and eye-salves; gurgles; fumi- 
gation of ear, nose and throat regions; liquid unguents, lotions, creams, oils, 
etc., for the skin; suppositories, tampons, soaked cotton swabs, etc., for 
the bodily openings; enemas and douches; various kinds of bath; fomenta- 
tions; antisepsis by fumigation; hypertonic salt solutions for surgical 
dressings; astringents as styptics for bleeding wounds and abrasions, etc. 
( 4 , pp. 248-50). As to the drugs, the Ayurveda has an extensive materia 
medica. The Caraka Sarphitd lists over 341 plant substances, 177 drugs of 
animal origin and 64 mineral compositions, while the Su^ruta Samhitd 
contains over 395, 57 and 64 respectively ( 4 , p. 251). Generally the plant 
products were preferred for both oral and non-oral medication, for it was 
believed that the organic plants were composed of the five bhutas while the 
inorganic metals and minerals were supposed to consist of prthvibhuta only. 
In addition, the availability of a wide variety of medically efficacious plants 
in the environment was also responsible for such a preference. A prac- 
titioner in Ayurvedic medicine was expected to observe high standards of 



R&UME 


581 


ethics of the medical profession, such as self-control, courage, compassion, 
purity of mind and body and expert knowledge of the medical science. He 
was enjoined to prepare medical prescriptions from carefully selected raw 
materials under his own supervision ( 4 , pp. 245-46). As a comprehensive 
medical science of all living creatures, the Ayurveda was concerned with the 
treatment of animals and plants too. There are special treatises dealing 
with the treatment of bovine animals (gavayurveda), horses {ahavaidya), 
elephants (hastyayurveda) and plants {vfk Ayurveda) ( 4 , pp. 254- 56). 
Besides, other standard works on the Ayurveda, some of the puranas and 
encyclopaedic works also contain sections of this type of medical procedures. 

Surgery 

Su^ruta describes surgery (iastrakarmd) under eight heads: chedana 
(incision), bhedana (excision), lekhana (scarification), vedhana (puncturing), 
esana (exploration), aharana (extraction), visrdvana (evacuation) and sivam 
(suturing). The surgical instruments described include 101 varieties of 
blunt instruments, and 20 kinds of sharp instruments, such as forceps, 
tongs, scalpels, catheters, bougies, trocar, syringes, speculums, needles, 
saws, scissors, lances, hooks and probes. A number of them resembled 
the mouths or beaks of birds, beasts or some other types of animals. 
Details are given of how they should be made from fine metal (steel 
or the paHcaloha), their dimensions, handles, etc. Cataract-crouching 
was an established surgical feat with which even the surgeons of 
ancient Greece and Egypt were not familiar. In the Susruta Samhitd 
there is a vivid account of craniotomy and anal fistual operation 
bestowing careful attention on pre- and post-operative treatments. The 
Indian surgeons were aware of how the blood vessels should be ligated, 
and often used cautery. They laid stress on practical training to attain the 
much needed proficiency in surgery. Incisions were practised on fruits, 
scarification on stretched skins of deer, goat or sheep with the hair still on 
them, puncturing on distended bags, venesection on blood vessels of dead 
cattle or the hollow stalks of lotus plants, cauterization on meats, suturing 
on thick cloth and so on. The marrow of jackfruits and similar types of 
pulps and the teeth of dead animals provided the practising ground for 
extraction. The suturing material employed generally was made of flax, 
hemp and bark fibres. D. Guthrie rightly observes: ‘It was in surgery 
above all that the ancient Hindus excelled. Susruta described more than a 
hundred instruments. This was their greatest contribution to the art of 
healing and the work was bold and distinctive. It is not unlikely, though 
difficult to prove, that some of it was of Greek origin. Some, indeed, state 
that the Greek drew much of their knowledge from the Hindus.’* As 
Neuberger says: ‘The outstanding feats of the ancient Indian surgery related 
to laparotomy, lithotomy and plastic operations.’*' The Susruta SamhitS

582

is regarded as the earliest document which gives a detailed account of rhino- 
plasty. Yet another feat related to the joining of the lips of wound by 
causing them to be bitten by ants and then cutting off the body of the ants, 
leaning behind the mandibles which would clamp the wound. The Arabs 
adopted this method later.® 

Indian medical knowledge and surgical practices influenced in no 
small way those in Greece and Arabia. The Hippocratic treatise On 
Breath deals in much the same way with its pneumatic system as we find 
in the Indian concept of vayu or prana. Plato in his Timaeos, strangely 
enough, discusses pathology almost in the same manner as the doctrine of 
the trido^a. Filliozat says: ‘India may very well have influenced the Hippo- 
cratic Collection and the Timaeos particularly, since Plato failed to 
mention his sources and since, moreover, his doctrine is closer to the Indian 
than to that of any contemporary Greek school. The influence of Indian 
ideas on certain aspects of Greek medicine during Plato’s time is further 
supported by the mention of Indian medicaments, including pepper, in the 
Diseases of Women, part of Hippocratic collection. Indian medical knowl- 
edge must have seeped through the Parthian empire, then the overlord of 
parts of India and Greece ahke along the trade routes described by Strabo 
and Pliny.’*^ Megasthenes described diseases of elephants and their reme- 
dies borrowed from the Hastydyurveda. The Roman Celsus (c. first century 
A.D.) gave in his medical works a graphic account of lithotomy which was 
practised in India much earlier. Galen (a.d. 131-201) of Pergamum, who 
spent most of his life in Rome, makes no secret of his borrowing from the 
Indian sources the material relating to ointment for the eyes and the Indian 
plaster. It is well known that the Indian herbals were sought after in the 
Roman world. 

Physical Concepts 

While the Ayurveda had established itself as medical science par 
excellence, there were, during the post-Vedic period, certain systems of philo- 
sophical thought which were assuming a crystallized or aphoristic form. 
Of them, the Vai§e§ika system deserves special mention. Supposed to 
have been propounded by a sage called Kanada, Kapabhuj or Ka 9 abhak§a, 
the Vaiie^ika Sutras deal with a number of physical concepts encompassing 
substance, attributes, motion, space, time and atomism in a cryptic form. 
It so happened that these concepts set the tone as it were for the inter- 
pretations of the physical world by a number of exponents over a long 
period of time. The Nydya Sutras, the proto-layers of which could be 
found even in the fourth century b.c., supported the Vai5e§ika views and, as 
could be expected, a syncretic Nyaya-Vai5e§ika school came into being in 
course of time. The Indian philosophical systems are of great value from 
the point of view of the physical ideas which developed in India.

N.B.P, Ware 

A new type of ceramic known as the Northern Black-polished ware came 
on the scene (c. 600-500 b.c.)» first in the region of modern Bihar and eastern 
Uttar Pradesh and in course of time spread to some of the other parts of 
northern, central and southern India. Made on a fast-spinning wheel using 
fine clay and fired to a high temperature in kilns under controlled conditions, 
this black-to-glossy-grey ceramic was reputed for its metallic sound. Its 
wide distribution and association with iron need special notice (5, pp. 
294-98). 

Glass 

It would appear that in the first quarter of the first millennium B.c. 
the technique of production of glass objects like beads and bangles, mostly 
the former, was known in India. Yet it was perhaps from the sixth century 
B.c. onwards that the progress of glass technology became noticeable. At 
Taxila the Bhir Mound has yielded in the sixth-fourth century b.c. levels a 
number of glass beads of several shapes and colours. As one of the out- 
posts of the north-western frontier of the Mauryan empire then, Taxila was 
prone to receive and assimilate foreign influences in the technique of glass 
production. That this was the case has been borne out by the glass objects 
found later at the new city of Sirkap at Taxila during first century B.c.-first 
century a.d. Production of glass objects was rather widespread inasmuch 
as a number of glass objects have been found in places like Ujjain, 
Nasik, Ahicchatra, Sravasti, Kolhapur, Kaundinya, Brahmagiri and 
Arikamedu to name a few out of some 30 sites known. The early Indian 
glass-makers were skilful in controlling the temperature of fusion, mould- 
ing, annealing, blotching and gold-foiling, the last being done in an 
exquisite manner (5, pp. 291-94). 

Iron 


In the post-Vedic period the knowledge of the use of iron in the form 
of a number of tools and implements was not only on the increase but also 
widespread. The use of bellows which made its debut during this period 
enabled the ironsmiths to produce a number of tools and implements on a 
large scale. Iron objects of different descriptions including bars, knives, 
hooks, sickles, arrowheads, hoes, rings, daggers, nails, choppers, etc., have 
been reported from a number of archaeological sites and the date-range of 
most of these finds is 600-200 B.c. The sharp iron implements were used 
with great effect in the clearance of jungles and expansion of settlements. 
The ploughshare tipped with iron enabled deep ploughing which resulted 
in more agricultural produce, particularly sugar-cane. The quality of iron 
and steel objects produced during this period was indeed of a high order 
and some of them were considered to be eminently fit for presentation.

Ktesias (fifth century b.c.) speaks of two swords of Indian steel presented 
to Artaxeses Mnemon. Later it has been recorded by Quintius Curtius 
that in the gifts which Alexander the Great received from Porus of Taxila 
(326 B.c.) were 100 ‘talents’ of steel. 

Agriculture 

Agriculture registered substantial progress during this period, particularly 
under the royal control and patronage of the Mauryan rulers. The Artha- 
iastra which sheds light on the importance attached to agriculture speaks 
of the science of agriculture and the Director of Agriculture. Likewise the 
State had accorded a special position to mining and minerals, for the agri- 
cultural produce and the minerals determined to a great extent its economy. 
It gave encouragement to the settlement of people on unoccupied land and 
vigorously supported agricultural practices. Keen interest was taken in the 
irrigation schemes as evidenced by the account of Megasthenes who informs 
us of officers employed by the State to superintend the rivers and inspect 
the sluices through which the water was let out from the main canals into their 
branches so as to ensure an equitable supply. Special mention should be 
made of the well-known Sudarsana Lake in Saurashtra, which was con- 
structed by Pusyagupta under Chandragupta Maurya and restored later by 
Tusaspa, the Yavana governor under Asoka, for irrigational purposes (6, pp. 
356-57). 


CLASSICAL AGE AND LATER UP TO c. 1200 a.d. 
Mathematics 

If the Classical Age represents a glorious period in the history of India, 
verily does it so in the history of Indian science and technology. From about 
the fourth century a.d. to about the eighth or ninth century and also a 
couple of centuries later, different branches of science made great headway 
and even became codified in the form of scientific and technical texts. The 
astronomical and mathematical texts are of particular significance. There 
were leading mathematicians who were also well versed in astronomy like 
Aryabhata I, BhSskara I, Brahmagupta, Mahavira, Aryabhata II, Munjala, 
Sripati, Sridhara and Bhaskara II. Aryabhata I knew rules for the extrac- 
tion of square and cube roots, dealt with areas of triangles and trapezia, 
circles, spheres, arithmetical progression, summation of series, fractions, 
etc. He enunciated a rule for the solution of indeterminate equation of the 
first order. He gave the value of n correct to four places of decimal (3*1416) 
though he knew it was approximate. He also gave the values of 24 sines 
(jyd) for the computation of trigonometrical angles; what is more, he devel- 
oped an alphabetical system for expressing numbers on the decimal place- 
value model. The decimal place-value notation itself, using nine digits and 
zero, was already in use in India by about the fifth century a.d. It is to be 



R^UMi 


585 


said to the credit of the Indians that they accorded a name, symbol and the 
right place for zero in an ingenious way. Severus Sebokht, a Syrian scholar 
of the seventh century a.d., referred to the Indian decimal place- value 
notation ‘a computing that surpasses description’ and was full of praise for 
the dexterity with which it was formulated. The decimal notation spread 
to Indo-China and Japan probably in the sixth or seventh century a.d., 
and the Indian numerals found an able exponent in the Arabic mathe- 
matician al-Khwarizmi in the ninth century a.d. Al-Khwarizmi’s works 
were translated into Latin in England by Adelard of Bath in the twelfth 
century and in the next century or so the Indian decimal place-value 
notation had established itself in Europe and has since become universal. 

Of the other contributions of the Indian mathematicians, those of 
Bhaskara I include a method of solving indeterminate equations of the first 
degree, while of Brahmagupta a formula for the sum of n terms of the 
Arithmetic Progression of which the first term is unity and the common 
difference is unity. The latter was able to state succinctly the rules regard- 
ing the volume of the prism, area of cyclic quadrilateral and the formula for 
the length of two diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral. He also “knew the 
theory of non-recurring continued fraction and gave the general solution in 
integers of the indeterminate equations of the first degree. Brahmagupta is 
well known for his dealing with the indeterminate equation of the second 
degree: ~ Mahavira has given an account of the use of zero 

and the summation of n terms of a Geometrical Progression. Bhaskara II 
developed a method known as cakravala or cyclic method for rational 
integral solutions of the indeterminate equation of the second order. He 
also worked out a geometric proof of the Pythagorean theorem. There is a 
view that Bhaskara almost hit upon the root idea of differential calculus, 
but as he did not conceive of the idea of limit he was unable to evolve the 
notion of modem calculus which, as we now know, owes its development 
to Newton and Leibniz. 

Astronomy 

In astronomy, there came into light a new class of astronomical litera- 
ture which went under the name of siddhdnta. Of the recognized 18 
siddhantas, five, viz. Saura, Vd§i$\ha, Paulina, Romaka and Paiidmaha, have 
been dealt with by Varahamihira in his PaHcasiddhdntikd, and of them, the 
SQryasiddhdnta is considered to be the best and most accurate. Although 
the date of this treatise is uncertain, its present form, presumably, contains 
different layers of astronomical ideas, some very old and the others 
comparatively recent. 

It is very likely that the divisions of time, the concept of mahdyuga^ 
cosmology, nak^atra system, etc., which are included in this work are 
among the ancient ideas while, possibly, the epicyClic theory and the 
associated views might have been later accretions, even so before the time of 
Varahamihira. Al-BlrOni says that the Suryasiddhdnta might have been 



586 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


formulated by one named Lata who in turn recorded the revelations of a 
solar divinity to an asura named Maya. There is a view that this astrono- 
mical compilation is probably Babylonian in origin, equating the asura to 
some Babylonian. Yet another view is that the asura Maya is an outlandish 
form of Turamaya (the Sanskrit form of Ptolemy of Egypt). 

The Suryasiddhanta deals with measurement of time, sine-tables and 
cosine functions, meridians, equinoxes and solstices, eclipses, planetary 
motions, inclination of the nak^atras to the ecliptic, heliacal risings and 
settings of stars, relative motions of the moon and the sun, some astrono- 
mical instruments and calendarial computations. While some of the 
astronomical ideas are related to the Alexandrian or Greek sources, there 
are also in the text not a few of the notions characteristically Indian. 

The Indian astronomers knew that the equinoctial and solstitial points 
do not remain stationary and to account for this they thought of a libratory 
motion instead of a rotatory precession. In the Suryasiddhanta it is stated 
that in a mahdyuga (a period of 4,320,000 years, at the end of which all the 
moving celestial bodies are presumed to return to their original positions 
after having completed a whole number of revolutions) the circle of asterism 
falls back eastward by thirty-score (30x20 = 600) revolutions. If the 
limits of the libratory movement are assumed to be 27° in either direction, 
it gives an annual rate of the motion of equinox as 54 seconds, which is 
near to the modem value of about 50 seconds per year. 

Of the Indian astronomers, Aryabhata I developed the theory of the 
rotation of the earth as well as that of the epicycles. Brahmagupta who 
did not accept the theory of Aryabhata regarding the rotation of the earth 
was an accredited astronomer not only in India but also in Arabia. His 
two astronomical treatises, Brdhmasphutasiddhanta and Khandakhadyaka, 
were rendered into Arabic by Muhammed ibn Ibrahim al-Fazari and 
Ya’qub ibn Tariq respectively in the late eighth century a.d., under the 
Arabic titles of Sindhind and Arkand, Al-Khwarizmi prepared an abridged 
version of the former. It is supposed that an Indian astronomer paid a 
visit to the court of Abbasid Caliph, al-Mansur, taking with him tables of 
the equations of planets and other astronomical data, Munjala worked 
out the corrections due to the precession of equinoxes in the sense of a 
retrograde motion and not of oscillation or libration. He even gave a correc- 
tion for the second inequality of the moon. iSripati based his astronomical 
work, Siddhantaiekhara, on the work of Brahmagupta and dealt with the 
moon’s second inequality. Bhaskara 11, following Brahmagupta, further 
elaborated the ideas concerning the revolution of the planets by epicyclic- 
eccentric theories. He also analysed the motion of the sun by considering 
the changes in longitude (2, pp. 92-124). 


Medicine 

The Ayurveda continued to maintain its high tradition and was in- 
cluded as one of the important subjects of study in the general curriculum 



r6sum6 


587 


of the universities at Nalanda, Srivikramasila and Valabhi. The Buddhist 
scholars attached great importance to the medical profession which enabled 
them to serve the sick and the emaciated as a part of their religious and 
social obligation. The noted medical writers of this period, Vagbhata and 
Nagaijuna, were Buddhists. Vagbhata’s Asfangahrdaya was by far the 
most concise exposition of the Ayurvedic knowledge. Important com- 
mentaries on this work were written by Arunadatta, Candrananda, Hemadri 
and Indu. Another valuable clinical guide dealing with the medical diag- 
nosis was the Rugviniscaya by Madhava, also known as the Madhavanidana 
(a compilation from the Caraka, Susruta and Asfdrigahrdaya), on which 
Vijayarak§ita (Madhukosa) and Vacaspati (Atankadarpana) wrote com- 
mentaries. Vrnda and Cakrapani produced valuable medical treatises in 
the form of Siddhayoga and Cakrasamgraha respectively ( 4 , pp. 226-27). 

The Arabs had an intimate knowledge of the Indian drugs when they 
established trading centres on the Malabar coast in the seventh century a.d. 
Later, when Sind was conquered by them, there was an active interchange 
of scholars well versed in different sciences. The Abbassid Caliphs gave 
great encouragement to the translation of the Indian medical texts. An 
emigrant Indian scholar translated the Susruta Samhitd into Arabic under 
the title of Kital-Samural-hind-i of ‘Susfud’. Ali ibn Zain translated the 
Car aka Samhitd into Arabic as the treatise of ‘Sarag’. The Mddhavaniddna 
and A^fdhgahrdaya were also rendered into Arabic under the titles of ‘Badan’ 
and ‘ Astankar’ respectively ( 4 , pp. 259-62). It is reported that Khalid, the 
Vazir of Caliph al-Mansur, was the son of the chief priest in a Buddhist 
monastery in Balkh. The chief priest was called a Barmark. When Balkh 
was conquered by the Caliphs, Khalid’s mother was also captured and the 
son, who was converted into Islam, became the founder of the Barmaki® 
family which is recognized to be responsible to a great extent for introducing 
Indian medicine, arithmetic and astronomy into Arabia. Under its direc- 
tion the medical, pharmacological and toxicological texts in Sanskrit were 
among the Indian scientific texts rendered into Arabic. Later, al-Razi or 
Rhazes (a.d. 865-925) incorporated the Indian medical knowledge in his 
comprehensive book known to medieval Europe as Liber continens {kitab-aL 
hawi) which was translated into Latin by Moses Farachi (c. thirteenth 
century a.d.) and which became the standard medical work of the Middle 
Ages.*’ 

In this period there were also two other schools of medicine, the 
Rasacikitsd and the Siddha, which mainly employed minerals or metallic 
compounds as well as the naturally occurring salts as medicines. The 
quasi-religious practices and tantrik procedures are an integral part of these 
two systems ( 4 , pp. 232-33) which extol mercury, sulphur, mica and the 
like as possessing divine healing powers, and are invariably linked with the 
alchemical and iatro-chemical practices.

A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


Alchemy and latro-chemistry 

By about the sixth or seventh century a.d. when the tantrik beliefs and 
practices were finding adherents in different strata of society, a new way, 
esoteric in essence, of understanding certain chemical substances and of pro- 
cessing them by an experimental technique of an entirely different character, 
made its appearance in India. Known as rasavidyd and centring round 
mercury, the rasa which was held in veneration because of its presumed divine 
origin as the creative essence of iSiva, this new approach developed into a 
complex system of thought and practice so as to aid the tantrik attainment 
of the eight siddhis (animadi). It was also a manifestation of human in- 
clination to surpass rigidities, be they of caste, sex or creed, that had taken 
firm roots in the Indian society. The tantras offered a system of thought 
and practice obliterating these rigidities by mystical ways which, it was 
tacitly assumed, would ensure a state of perpetual youth to the body and 
a divine experience to the mind. In respect of the former, mercurial 
preparations and compositions of a number of other chemical substances, 
principally mica and sulphur, were considered to be extremely potent for 
the preparation of the elixir of life. On deeper analysis, it would seem that 
this particular strand of thought, alchemical in content, owes its origin to 
the other culture-areas, notably China and Arabia, with which India had 
intimate contacts during this period. 

In its fully developed form, the mercury-based alchemy in India relates 
to the male-female symbolism (mercury and sulphur presumed to be the prin- 
ciples of Siva and his consort respectively) and its association with cinnabar 
(mercuric sulphide) which was assumed to be the main life-prolonging essence. 

It is not unlikely that the Indian alchemy obtained its seed ideas from 
the southern regions of China where a similar type of alchemical thought 
based on Yin (female) and Yang (male) which extolled cinnabar in the same 
way is noticed. Nevertheless, the rasavadins adapted them in such a way that 
in a century or two the alchemical knowledge became formalized in a way 
characteristically Indian. The twin aspects of alchemy, viz. preparation of 
the elixir of life and transmutation of base metals into gold or silver^ were 
fostered with considerable ingenuity, although the former was the main 
concern of the alchemists in India. 

The rasavidyd gradually developed into a methodical knowledge and 
a number of texts which presented a wide variety of alchemical knowledge 
appeared from about the tenth century onwards. The rasaMstra texts, as 
they came to be known, describe a number of chemical substances under 
the mahdrasaSy uparasas, navaratnas, dhdtuSy poisons and plants as also 
many apparatus (5, pp. 322-33), some of them complicated, used for pro- 
cessing these substances. A detailed study of these texts reveals how skilled 
were the rasavddins in performing a number of ^purificatory’ processes in 
order to remove the deleterious effects of the metals and minerals so that the 
latter would become eminently fit for internal use. Of them, the eighteen 
samskdras of mercury merit particular mention. They include rubbing 



Kksimi 


589 


with various medically efficacious plant juices and extracts, incorporation of 
sulphur, mica, certain alkaline substances, etc. The rasavadins believe that 
mercury, after it has undergone sequentially the seventeen processes, has all 
the powers of transmutation. At this stage it should be tested for its 
powers and, if the test is positive, it should be used for the eighteenth 
process leading to its assimilation into and the rejuvenation of the body 
(5, pp. 320-22). This concept seems to be peculiar to Indian alchemy. 

There is yet another alchemical practice peculiar to India and this 
relates to the prime substance known as muppu which occupies an important 
place in the Tamil works on alchemy. Regarded as the union of three 
naturally obtained salts (punlru, kalluppu and an4akkal), muppu is recog- 
nized as of four types, viz. vMa muppu, vaidya muppu, yoga and jhana 
muppu. The first is used in the Tamilian alchemy, the second in the Siddha 
system of medicine, the third and fourth seem to connote their effect on 
spiritual practices. It would appear that the Tamilian muppu corresponds 
to the later European concept of Philosophers’ Stone’, for the muppu, 
with compounds of mercury added to it, is presumed to possess extraordinary 
potency of transmuting baser metals into gold as well as rejuvenating the 
human system. There seemed to be a number of methods of preparing 
muppu of the desired potency and these are kept as closely guarded secrets 
by the practitioners of the Siddhavidyd and alchemy (5, pp. 334-38). 

There are a number of medical texts dealing with alchemy in Tamil and 
a careful study of them may be of great value from the point of view of the 
history of the movement of alchemical ideas. For, one of the reputed 
Tamilian alchemists, by name Ramadevar, says in one of his works® that 
he visited Arabia, assumed the name of Yaqub and taught the muppu salt- 
based alchemy there (perhaps in the eleventh or twelfth century a.d.). 
Interestingly enough, in the fifteenth century Paracelsus, a Swiss physician, 
gave a new direction and meaning to alchemy by introducing salt as the 
third fundamental principle in addition to mercury and sulphur, and by 
exhorting that alchemy was to engage itself in the noble task of transform- 
ing the naturally occurring minerals into medicinal compositions beneficial 
to humanity. It is well known that such an attitude liad already found 
roots in the Siddha system of medicine and also in the iatro-chemical 
rasasdstra texts in India. 

In particular salt was given a proper place in addition to mercury and 
sulphur in the Tamilian alchemy. Perhaps protracted studies may bring 
to surface the historical link in the movement of alchemical ideas between 
India and the west. 

Atomism 

In the Classical Age and the succeeding centuries the philosophical 
works of the Nyaya and the Vai^esika systems and some of the Bauddha 

• Cunmkd^lidam 600 by Yaqub, verse Nos. 227 and 466.

A CX)NCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


and Jaina schools, which came out with full intellectual vigour presenting 
strong epistemological positions, are of great importance. In them is found 
a rational explanation of the basic stuff of the gross world in terms of atoms. 
The Nyaya-Vaik^ika texts, in particular, describe in detail and in a logical 
way the formation of gross bodies from the atoms through dyads {dvyanuka) 
and triads {tryanuka or trasarenu). The four bhutas-—prihvl, ap, tejas and 
are considered to be atomic in their eternal states. The two atoms 
are regarded as the material cause for the coming into being of a dyad which 
is an effect. Three dyads are the cause for producing a triad which is again 
an effect. The cause brings about the effect, but is absorbed immediately 
into the latter which in turn assumes the role of a cause to continue the 
sequence. The noteworthy characteristic of Indian atomism is the causal 
garment associated with it. Further, according to the Nydya-Vaisesika, two 
like atoms unite only in the presence of another type of atom, the latter 
functioning as an accessory cause, and this explains conclusively the presence 
of different qualities in a single substance. Also, it is pointed out that the 
structural arrangement {vyiiha) of the dyads in a triad gives rise to different 
qualities in a substance. Such a profound concept, which can bear 
testimony even from the modern chemical point of view, is not found in 
the early schools of atomism elsewhere including the Greek atomism 
(9, pp. 461-69). 

In the west, the atomic views of Greek thinkers found an able exponent 
in Lucretius (first century b.c.), but later for reasons unknown® practically 
receded to the background for over a thousand and six hundred years, for 
it was only in the seventeenth century a.d. that Gassendi, Boyle, Newton and 
Huygens revived them with certain modifications. On the other hand, the 
Vai^e§ika atomism found a number of protagonists for over two thousand 
years right up to the eighteenth century a.d. Though sometimes bordered 
on polemics, the Indian atomism was virile enough to attract into its fold 
the intellectuals of different dispositions either as adherents or opponents. 

Impetus Theory 

Yet another Indian physical concept of considerable relevance to the 
history of science, which found adequate expression in the Vai5e§ika texts, 
the Prasastapadabha^ya and the Vyomavatl, relates to the notion of impetus to 
account for continued motion of a body. It is postulated that when the 
body experiences the first unit of motion, a quality of impetus (vega) is 
possessed by it; and as a result the body continues to move in the same 
direction. However, when the moving body encounters an obstacle, it 
would come to rest or continue its motion with diminished strength accord- 
ing as the latter neutralizes the quality of impetus fully or partially. The 
texts also describe the motion of bodies like an arrow, javelin and pestle. 


It may be noted that Aristotle opposed the atomic views of his predecessors and it was 
the Aristotelian interpretation of the physical world that held a dominating position 
in Europe for a long time. 



RESUME 


591 


It is interesting to observe that in the west it was not before the fourteenth 
century a.d. that we come across a theory of impetus which permitted a 
description of continued motion of a projectile. Till then the Aristotelian 
views of the motion in terms of the projector transforming to the immediate 
layer of air (medium) the power to thrust the projectile, the layer transfer- 
ring its impulse to the next layer of air and so forth held the field, although 
in the sixth century a.d. John Philoponus of Alexandria, who did not 
concur with this view, suggested that the projector imparted a motive power 
to the projectile itself. The Vaisesika conception of impetus in all its details 
is a distinct forerunner of what was later developed in the west on mathe- 
matical lines (9, pp. 472-75). 

Biological Sciences 

Plants and animals received adequate attention of poets of nature, 
lexicographers, encyclopaedists and philosophers who in their works have 
given considerable details of their types, characteristics, habitats, etc. 
Kalidasa in his great lyrics and dramas has given a vivid description of the 
plant and animal life, particularly of the birds and insects. Amara de- 
scribes a wide range of plants and animals along with their synonyms accord- 
ing to their habitats and habits. In the Brhatsamhita is found an account 
of plant pathology (7, p. 385) and of animals including cow, dog, cock, 
goat, horse, elephant, etc. Prasastapada, the well-known exponent of the 
Vaisesika system, attempts at a simple but meaningful classification of 
animals and plants. The animals are categorized into ayonija (asexually 
produced) and yonija (sexually produced), the latter being further sub- 
divided into jarayuja and ari<Jlaja (8, pp. 426-27). Plants are classified 
into vrksa, trna, osadhi, gulma, lata, avatana and vanaspati. 

A work of considerable interest from the point of view of the botanical 
knowledge of this period is Vfksayurveda of Para^ara. Though presumed 
to be a text belonging to the first century B.c. or first century a.d., there is 
no doubt that it has many later accretions. In any case, this text gives 
succinctly an outline of plant morphology and certain aspect of plant 
physiology, as also a graphic description of the germinating process. It 
presents a system of nomenclature based on three factors, viz. the botanical 
significance, therapeutic value and habitat (7, pp. 379-80). 

Technological Practices 

As to the technological practices of the Classical Age, metal-working 
was in a flourishing state. The historic vestiges like the Iron Pillar at 
Delhi and the copper statue of the Buddha at Sultanganj in Bihar bear 
eloquent testimony to the skills of the metalsmiths of the time. The Iron 
Pillar which has a height of about 24 feet and a weight of more than six 
tons is made of wrought or malleable iron (99*72 %) and has remained still 
without any signs of rust even though it is about 1,500 years old. The 
huge statue of the Buddha—about seven feet six inches in height and nearly 



592 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


a ton in weight— was cast in two layers with great dexterity (5, pp. 299-300). 
There is no doubt that the metal-workers displayed spectacular skills in 
producing new appliances and utilitarian forms. The art of jewellery using 
precious metals and stones was in a flourishing form. There were in different 
parts of the country centres well known for metal industry producing 
exquisite metallic forms; and dhatuvada (metal-working) came to be regarded 
as one of the 64 kalas, Hiuen Tsang, the Chinese pilgrim, describes a 
huge copper image of the Buddha (80 ft. in height) and a brass temple 
(height expected to reach over a 100 ft.) by Emperor Harsha. Though the 
furnaces employed for winning the metals from their ores were small and 
primitive from the modern standards, the metal-workers had developed the 
necessary expertise and aimed at excellence. In south India, bronze- 
working in an elegant style was in a flourishing state. Similarly, advanced 
state of workmanship and sophistication were exhibited in the production of 
ceramic ware of high appeal. Special types of glossy pottery were produced 
using mica dust and in graceful designs. At Ahicchatra have been 
observed cylindrical pits of large dimensions and it is probable that these 
were the special types of kilns for the turning and baking of ornamental 
pottery and tiles. 

Agriculture 

But the more important component of the economic well-being of the 
people of the Classical Age, and a couple of centuries succeeding it, was, 
undoubtedly, agriculture as evidenced by rather a wide variety of agricultural 
products raised in different parts of the country and also the royal en- 
couragement given to irrigation works. In addition, the use of araghatta 
for irrigation purposes was on the increase. As the State had realized the 
importance of the cultivation of waste lands, land-grants were made in an 
increasing measure on many an occasion. Agricultural practices received 
adequate attention of codifiers like Amara and Varahamihira who included 
them in their well-known compilations. Some of the other works like the 
Ndradasmftiy Brhaspatism^tU Vismdharmottara and the Agnipurdna, too, 
dealt with agricultural and allied practices. What is more, time was ripe 
for the appearance of even specific texts like the K(:^i-Pardiara (6, p. 358) and 
the Vf^k^dyurveda (6, p. 362) which, exclusively devoted to agriculture and 
horticulture, became reference manuals. Cryptic sayings in the regional 
languages like Bengali, Maithili and Tamil portraying agricultural practices 
entered the folklore, and the farmers spared no efforts in living up to them. 

The foregoing bird’s-eye account shows how the different branches of 
science had taken roots in India by about the twelfth century or so and 
how India participated effectively in the evolution and even transmission 
of scientific ideas and techniques. It is refreshing to note that Said-al- 
Andalusi, an astronomer and historian of science in the eleventh century 
A.D., accords in his work, Kitdb Tabakat al-Umam (the Categories of 
Nations), the first place to India among the contemporary nations which 



R&iUMl§ 


593 


had developed sciences then. In the next two or three centuries which in 
the west provided the decisive converging historical and social influences 
to usher in the Renaissance later, India’s scientific output began to show 
signs of decay. The foreign invasions and internecine strifes, which unleased 
forces of disruption and unsettlement on the one hand and the rigid caste- 
ridden social structure which was impermeable to new outlook and endeav- 
ours on the other, seemed to be too powerful to stimulate scientific think- 
ing. In effect, history did not appear to be on the side of India during the 
crucial two or three centuries so that India could participate in the 
Renaissance and thus become one of the early homes of modem science. 


MEDIEVAL PERIOD 

In the medieval period from about the twelfth century to the end of 
the eighteenth century a.d., the history of science and technology in India 
developed two facets, one concerned with the already chartered course of 
the earlier tradition and the other with the new influences which came up 
as a result of the Islamic and later the European impacts. These two did 
not always run parallel, nor were they invariably complementary to each 
other. But they existed side by side, sometimes endeavouring to assimilate 
the impact of each other. A noteworthy feature was that several important 
scientific works, particularly in astronomy and medicine, were rendered 
from Sanskrit to Persian or Arabic and vice versa. Though in respect of 
scientific ideas the mutual impact was not so appreciable and each strand 
of scientific thought proceeded generally along the established path, the 
technological practices undoubtedly underwent perceptible changes and, in 
fact, some new technological developments took place in such fields as 
paper, gunpowder, enamelling, glass and metal-working. In addition, 
certain types of new plants and fresh horticultural practices also appeared. 
These developments, however, looked dwarfs before the new intellectual 
endeavours that Europe witnessed in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries 
and the gigantic strides of modem science and technology thereafter. The 
Indian astronomy, mathematics, physics, chemical practices, plant and 
animal sciences chose to move in the previously determined grooves and so 
were unable to develop a fresh method and an attitude conducive to the 
development of modem science. Most of the scientific works which 
appeared in the medieval period were in the nature of commentaries or 
expositions of the earlier treatises. 

Astronomy 

In astronomy, after Bhaskara 11, a number of commentaries dealing 
with the already established astronomical notions appeared. 

Mahendra Suri, who flourished in the court of Emperor Firoz Shah 
Tughlak as one of his court astronomers, wrote a tract called Yantrardja 
38 



594

dealing with astronomical instruments.® Parame^vara, who belonged to 
Kerala, was a prolific commentator on the Suryasiddhanta, Mahdbhdskanyay 
etc. In Kerala were families of astronomers and almanac-makers. Nfla- 
kantha Somasutvan, who was the disciple of ParameSvara’s son, was a 
noted commentator of Aryabhafiya, He also wrote a few original works 
containing refined methods of astronomical calculations. Cakradhara, 
Makaranda, Lak§midasa, Jnanaraja and Gatie^a Daivajna were the other 
commentators. In his GrahaldgkavOy GaneSa Daivajna avoided trigono- 
metrical calculations and introduced simple arithmetical methods instead. 
There were also families of astronomers in Maharashtra and of them 
special mention should be made of the Divakara family. Divakara was 
himself a disciple of Ga^ieSa Daivajna and his family produced well-known 
commentators such as Vi§i?u, Nfsiipha and Kamalakara. To another 
family of astronomers represented by Vallala, who migrated from Madhya 
Pradesh to Banaras, belonged Kfsna Daivajna who wrote valuable 
commentaries on the works of Bhaskara II. His brother, Raghunatha, 
produced a commentary on the Suryasiddhdnta and Raghunatha’s son, 
Muni^vara, brought out Mariciy a commentary on the Siddhdntdiromani of 
Bhaskara II. Islamic astronomical ideas had penetrated already into the 
minds of some Indian astronomers of whom Kamalakara was reputed for 
lending his suppot to the former. Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II of Jaipur was 
greatly interested in astronomy and was well acquainted with Ptolemy’s 
Almagest and Euclid’s Elements in Arabic versions, as also with the works of 
the Maragha school of astronomers like Na§Iru’d-din-at-Tusi, al-Gurgani, 
Jamashid Kashi and Ulugh Beg. He even had considerable knowledge of 
the European astronomy. It was Jai Singh who set up the five observatories 
which stand as monuments to his deep interest in astronomy at Delhi, Ujjain, 
Banaras, Mathura and Jaipur. 

Comprising massive instruments in masonry, these observatories 
enabled him and the astronomers associated with his work to record a 
number of observations which formed part of his astronomical table, the 
ZJj Muhammed Shahiy compiled both in Persian and Sanskrit. In this 
task, he had the able assistance of his principal astronomer Jagannatha 
Paodita. The instruments, JaiPrakdsh, Rdm-yantra and Samrdf-yantray are 
Jai Singh’s own inventions. Jagannatha translated Ptolemy’s Almagest 
into Sanskrit under the title the Samrd(-siddhdnta (2, pp. 101-103). 

Mathematics 

NSrayana Paijdita, son of Nfsirpha Daivajna, was well known for his 
work on arithmetic, Ganitakaumudi, and on algebra, BJjaganitdvatamsay on 
which later a number of commentaries appeared. Gahgadhara of Gujarat 
wrote a commentary on theLildvati and his brother, Vi§iju Paijdita, produced 

• The versatile metallic instrument, astrolabe, was introduced into India by the Muslims 
and it was already in use during the reign of Shah Jahan. Lahore was routed for the 
production of astrolabes of hish quality.

an arithmetic called Ganitasdra on the model of Srldhara’s work. Para- 
me^vara’s commentaries included among others Bhatadipikd (on the Arya- 
bha(Iya)y Karmadlpikd and Siddhantadipikd (on the Mahdbhdskanya), the 
Lildvatl-vydkhyd. In Kerala there also came into light works such as 
Karanapaddhati, Ganitayuktibhdsd and Sadratnamala which gave rules for 
trigonometrical sine, cosine, tan and n series. Nilakanlha Somasutvan pro- 
duced Tantrasamgraha which also contains rules of trigonometrical series. 

Apart from his profound scholarship in Indian astronomical calcula- 
tions, Gane^a Daivajna produced Buddhivildsinl, a commentary on the 
Lilavatl, containing a number of illustrations. Kamalakara’s brother, 
Raghunatha, composed a commentary entitled Mitabhd^ini on the LUdvatl. 
Kr^na of the Vallala family brought out Navdhkura on the BJjaganita of 
Bhaskara II in which is found an elaboration of the rules of indeterminate 
equation of the first and second orders. Nllakantha Jyotirvid, who was in 
the court of Akbar, compiled Tajik (also an astrological work) introducing 
a large number of Persian technical terms. Fai?I, at the behest of Akbar, 
produced a Persian version of the LUdvatl^ and Ata Ullah Rashid! translated 
Bhaskara’s BJjaganita during the reign of Shah Jahan. Jagannatha who, as 
stated before, was in the court of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh of Jaipur, trans- 
lated Euclid’s Elements under the Sanskrit title of Rekhdganitay from the 
Arabic version Tahrir-u UqTidas by Na§!ru*d-din-at-Tnsi. The Samarqand 
school of mathematics and astronomy also penetrated into India, particu- 
larly during the Mughal period. Both Babar and Humayun evinced keen 
interest in mathematics and astronomy. Akbar caused the introduction of 
mathematics as a subject of study among others in the educational system. 
Interesting it is to note that in the different libraries in India there are a 
number of Arabic versions of Euclid’s Elements and its commentaries, 
geometrical works of Archimedes and copies of works of mathematicians 
of the Middle East and Central Asia. Na§Iru’d-din-at-Jusi, the founder- 
director of the Maragha observatory, was recognized as the authority 
among the Muslim scholars. Arabic versions of his works are also avail- 
able in some of our libraries. 

Medicine 

Though Ayurveda did not progress as vigorously as it did in the ancient 
period, some important treatises like the Sdrangdhara Sarphitd, the Cikiisdsarp- 
graha by Vahgasena (a redaction of the earlier Samhitd by Agastya who 
was one of the Siddhas of south India), the Yogaratndkara (popular in south 
India) and the Bhdvaprakdia of Bhavami^ra were compiled. The Sdrang- 
dhara Sarphitd, a text of the thirteenth century includes opium in its materia 
medica and employs pulse and urine examination for diagonostic purpose, 
possibly following Chinese and Arabic practice. The Bhdvaprakdia con- 
tains an exhaustive list of diseases and their symptoms, as also of drugs 
current in his time. The etiology of syphilis which was introduced into India 
by the Portuguese seamen in the fifteenth century is also discussed in the 



596 


A CONCISE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN INDIA 


text. The drugs mentioned include metallic preparation of the rasacikitsa 
system and even imported drugs. 

As to the rasacikitsa system, it started as non-Ayurvedic in its approach 
and dealt principally with a host of mineral medicines, both mercurial and 
non-mercurial. Some esoteric views concerning mercury, mica, sulphur, 
copper sulphate, etc., also got mixed up with the therapeutic procedures of 
this system. Though initially subscribed to the male-female symbolism 
and adopted a classification of substances in tune with this symbolism, the 
rasacikitsa school gradually adopted the paHcabhuta doctrine, supposing 
that mercury, the main pillar of this system, was an embodiment of all the 
bhutas. The Siddha system, mostly prevalent in Tamilnad and attributed 
to the reputed Siddhas, who were supposed to have evolved many a life- 
prolonging composition, is particularly rich in mineral medicines. The 
efficacy of these medicines is sought to be enhanced by the use of specially 
processed naturally obtained salts known as muppu. There was no doubt 
an interaction between the rasacikitsa school and the Ayurvedic system to 
mutual advantage. 

Another important system of medicine which flourished in India in 
the medieval period is the Unani Tibb, sometimes referred to as Arabian 
medicine by the western historians, for it came down to them through the 
Arabic medical writers. It is also known as Unani because it is based upon 
the Greek system of medicine (Unani being an outlandish name for Ionia of 
the Greek Archipelago). It should be emphasized that the Greek medicine 
when it reached Arabia underwent certain modifications at the hands 
of Arabic medical writers who also incorporated into it some of the Persian 
as well as the Indian medical traditions. Ali bin Rabban summarized the 
whole system of Greek medicine as well as the Indian medical knowledge 
in his book, FirdausuA-Hikmat, His disciple, al-Razi or Rhazes, studied 
both the systems. The work of Avicena, the most famous Arabic medical 
writer, is known as Qdnun (the Canon) which has been accepted in India 
as the greatest authority of Unani Tibb, 

The Unani came to India along with the Muslims by about the eleventh 
century and soon found a congenial environment for its growth. During 
the reign of Alauddin Khalji there were already a number of Hakims of 
repute. Muhammed bin Tuglaq was not only a patron of Unani but also 
well versed in the Unani Tibb, At his instance Hakim Diya Muhammad 
compiled a book, Majmu'-e-Diyady incorporating the Arabic, Persian and 
Ayurvedic medical knowledge. Firoz Shah Tughlaq who had a compre- 
hensive knowledge of UnOni Tibb wrote a book, Tibbe Firozshahi, During 
the time of Sikandar Lodi the Hakims and the Vaidyas worked together. 
Mian Taha, the Amir of Sikandar Lodi, is said to have remembered by 
heart as many as 24,000 verses on Indian medicine. Apart from the Delhi 
Sultans, the provincial Muslim rulers in Gujarat and the Deccan encour- 
aged Hakims and Vaidyas and caused either translations or independent 
mescal works to be written. But it was in the period of the Mughals 
that the Undni Tibb registered rapid progress and became increasingly 



R&UM]§ 


597 


popular. The Hakims were held in high esteem and enjoyed royal patron- 
age. The rewards and remunerations paid to them were so attractive that 
not a few highly qualified Hakims from Iran and other places came to 
India and worked in many new free public hospitals which the Mughal 
rulers established in all the cities under their control. A fact that should 
not go unnoticed is that in these hospitals thousands of Hakims and the 
Ayurvedic Vaidyas worked side by side. Lahore, Delhi, Lucknow, Patna, 
Murshidabad, Hyderabad and Madras were the important centres of 
Unani Tibb, which had well-qualified Unani hospitals and Madrasas of Tibb. 
A good number of medical works also appeared during the Mughal rule. 
The Tibbi Aurangzebi, dedicated to Aurangzeb, is based on Ayurvedic 
sources. The Musalajati-Ddrshikohi of Nuruddin Muhammad, dedicated 
to Darashikoh, deals with Greek medicine and contains at the end almost 
the whole Ayurvedic materia medica. 

Some independent contributions to the TibbUUndni were also made by 
Hakims on the basis of their own experiences of medical cases which they 
handled with great care and originality. They developed treatment of the 
venereal diseases and made fresh contributions to epidemology, toxicology, 
therapeutics and Unani Materia Medica. 

Study of Animals and Plants 

In the thirteenth century a.d,, Haipsadeva compiled, at the instance of 
Saudadeva, the Jaina king of Jinapura, a work known as M^ga-paksi-idstra 
which gives a general, though not always, scientific account of some of the 
beasts and birds of hunting. The Muslim kings of India, as warriors and 
hunters, maintained a fleet of pedigree animals, such as horses, dogs, 
cheetahs and falcons. The Mughal kings who were fascinated by the 
animals, both domesticated and wild, have described in their memoirs and 
biographies the distinctive characters, ecology, anatomical aspects, local 
names, etc., of the animals which were in their menageries. Babur and 
Akbar, amidst their political preoccupations and war, found time to fondle 
and study them. Akbar evinced special interest in producing good breeds 
of domestic animals, elephants and horses; and the breeds of horses in his 
stables were as fine and sturdy as those of Arabia. His possessions in- 
cluded as many as about 9,000 cheetahs or hunting leopards, a species 
practically extinct now in India. The greatest naturalist of the Mughal 
kings was undoubtedly Jahangir who in his Tuzuk-i-Jahangtri recorded his 
observations and experiments of breeding trials and hybridization. He 
described about 36 species of animals. His court artists, specially Mansur, 
produced elegant and accurate portraiture of animals, some of which are 
still preserved in several museums and private collections. 

As a naturalist, Jahangir was interested in the study of plants, and his 
court artists in the floral portraiture. Some 57 plants have been described 
in his work, as also the types of inflorescence, pollination and methods of 
fruit preservation.

Chemical Practices 

Of the new technological practices which soon established themselves 
in the medieval period, special mention should be made of paper-making, 
gunpowder and pyrotechnics. The art of paper-making was introduced 
into India probably in the eleventh century a.d. from Nepal which in turn 
might have obtained the technique of paper production from China. Before 
the introduction of paper, the ancient literature was preserved generally on 
palm-leaves in south India and birch-bark in Kashmir and northern regions 
of the country. About the fourteenth or fifteenth centuiy a.d. paper began 
to be used and, in the later half of the fifteenth century, Kashmir was 
producing paper of attractive quality from the pulps of rags and hemp 
with lime and soda added to whiten the pulp. Sialkot, Zafarabad, 
Patna, Murshidabad, Ahmedabad, Aurangabad and Mysore were among 
the well-known centres of paper production. Zafarabad was significantly 
known as Kaghalishaher (paper city) and produced glossy and strong paper 
from bamboo pulp. Ahmedabad’s paper was of export quality, glossy 
and in different sizes and colours. During Tippu’s time, Mysore possessed 
a paper-making factory producing a special type of paper having gold 
surface. The technique of paper-making was practically the same through- 
out the country, differing only in the preparation of the pulp from different 
raw materials. The Mughal rulers and the Peshwas gave considerable 
encouragement to the production of paper which became an important 
vehicle of royal communication and legal transactions. 

Gunpowder was an article of warfare at the beginning of the sixteenth 
century. The Mughals knew the technique of production of gunpowder 
and its use in gunnery. The Indian craftsmen were quick to learn the 
technique and evole suitable explosive compositions. The ^ukramti, a six- 
teenth- or seventeenth-century treatise in Sanskrit attributed to Sukracarya, 
contains a description of how the gunpowder can be prepared using salt- 
petre, sulphur and charcoal in different ratios for use in different types of 
guns. Such formulations were not unknown in India earlier, because 
certain composition of fireworks were already in use. The available 
evidence seems to indicate that pyrotechnic practices were current in India 
even in the thirteenth or fourteenth century. There are works dealing 
with pyrotechnics in Sanskrit, Marathi, Tamil, Malayalam and Persian. 
The principal types of fireworks included those which pierce through air 
(rockets), produce sparks of fire, blaze with variegated colours and end 
with explosion. Generally metal-dusts were used for the production of 
sparklings of different colours. Spectacular display of fireworks was a 
common feature in marriages, major religious festivals and royal ceremonies 
in medieval India as even now. 

The metalsmiths, particularly in the central, eastern and southern parts 
of India, were known for the production of intricate forms of both copper 
and bronze images which were being produced on a large scale by the 
well-known cire perdue process. Metal icons were fabricated according to

the traditional measurements in an attractive style, erecting several figures 
even on one pedestal. Iron-smelting and forging operations were also 
followed with further achievements such as the production of large iron 
pillars for use in temples, and of damascened swords using steel of high 
quality. The latter were in great demand in foreign countries at that time. 
Cosmetics and perfumes were becoming increasingly popular and some 
new compositions also appeared to cater to the needs of the royal baths 
and religious ceremonies, particularly during the Mughal period. Ain-i- 
Akbari speaks of the ‘Regulations of the Perfume Office of Akbar*. The 
attar of roses was a popular perfume, the discovery of which is attributed 
to the mother of Nuijehan. 

Agriculture 

As to agriculture, the pattern of raising food crops practically remained 
the same as in early India. However, important changes occurred in the 
introduction of new crops, trees as well as horticultural plants by the 
foreign traders and enforcement of new land tenure system by the rulers. 
The principal crops were wheat, rice, barley, millets, pulses, oilseeds, cotton, 
sugar-cane and indigo, and of them the cultivation of cotton was on the 
increase and that of sugar-cane more widespread in Mughal times. The 
Western Ghats continued to yield black pepper of good quality and Kashmir 
maintained its tradition for saffron and fruits. Ginger and cinnamon from 
the Tamilnad, cardamom, sandalwood and coconuts from Kerala were 
becoming increasingly popular. Indigo plantation was widespread in 
Bengal and Khandesh, and the best quality came from Bayana region near 
Agra. Tobacco, chillies, potato, guava, custard apple, cashew and pine- 
apple were the important new plants which made India their new home 
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Malwa and Bihar regions 
were also well known for the production of opium from the poppy plants. 
On the Western Ghats the cultivation of coffee plants had just begun in the 
seventeenth century. Improved horticultural methods were adopted with 
great success. The systematic mango-grafting, introduced by the Jesuits 
of Goa in the middle of the sixteenth century, improved the native fruit to 
a phenomenal extent. During Shah Jahan’s rule the plantation of tem- 
perate climate fruits, till then confined to imperial gardens, was extended to 
other suitable areas and this resulted in an extensive cultivation of fruit 
trees in the country. 

As regards irrigation, wells, tanks and canals continued to be the 
principal means of irrigation. In the Panjab arhat or rahat (Persian 
wheel), in the Agra region the charas (a sort of a bucket made of leather 
used to lift water with the help of yoked oxen) and at places where the 
water-level was high the denkli were the water-lifting devices. In the south, 
tanks were constructed in increasing numbers. In the north, canals like 
the Eastern Jamuna canal and Nahr-i-d-Bihist conveyed water from long 
distances to the fields. Of the agricultural implements, special mention

should be made of a seed-sowing machine, consisting of a wooden bowl 
with three or four tube outlets so as to deposit seeds behind the coulters, 
which was already in use in the early part of the eighteenth century. In 
the medieval period agriculture was placed on a solid foundation by the 
State which brought about a system of land measurement and land classi- 
fication, beneficial both to the rulers and the tillers. 


WESTERN SCIENCE IN INDIA UP TO c. 1900 

Modern science, noted for its methodology of induction and concerned 
essentially with the phenomenal world as against the noumenal, developed 
firm roots in Europe, particularly in Italy, France, England, Germany and 
Scandinavia in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It so happened 
that in these two centuries the Portuguese, Dutch, French and the British 
had established commercial and colonial interests in India. The versatile 
Europeans who came to India as missionaries, explorers or administrators 
were attracted by the flora, fauna, minerals, geographic features, climatic 
conditions and the like; in other words, by the natural treasures of India. 
Even though the Britishers, who ultimately became the paramount rulers 
of India in the later half of the eighteenth century, were by and large instru- 
mental in the promotion of modern science in India for over a hundred and 
fifty years, India had already the glimpses of modern scientific investi- 
gations in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. 

Beginnings of Botanical Investigations 

Garcia da Orta, the Portuguese physician, who came to Goa in 1534, 
studied and nursed a number of Indian medicinal plants, and his Colloquies 
contains an account of local fruits and plants. Later Hendrich Van Rheede, 
the Dutch Governor of Malabar Coast, also investigated a number of 
plants and seeds with the help of some European surgeotis with whom he 
came into contact and the local medical practitioners whom he employed 
for the purpose. In the eighteenth century, botanical investigations took 
rapid strides. On the Madras coast the Dane, John Gerhard Koenig, 
who joined the Tranquebar Mission as a surgeon and later became the 
Natural Historian of the East India Company in the Madras Presidency, 
gathered huge specimens of plants and sent many of them to the University 
of Lund in Sweden. At Calcutta, Robert Kyd paved the way for the 
establishment of the Royal Botanic Garden for nursing commercially 
beneficial plants. The Garden, which came into being in 1787 at Sibpur 
on the west bank of the River Hooghly, became a place of botanical studies 
through the efforts of William Roxburgh. The Indian Linnaeus and 
Father of Indian botany, as Roxburgh was known later, d^ up a cata- 
logue of about 3,500 species growing in the Garden and, employing local 
artists, prepared illustrations of a number of plants, which appe«ued in

1814 under the name Hortus Bengalensis. He also produced Flora Indica 
and Plantae Coromandaliane (10, pp. 491-93). 

Survey 

Early in the eighteenth century, the French geographer, Delise, pub- 
lished a fairly accurate map of the southern coast of India (1723) and 
Bourignon d’Anville prepared the well-known Carte de VInde (1752) based 
upon the then available knowledge brought to him by the Jesuit missionaries. 
But, a systematic survey of the country was achieved only by the Britishers 
after they established their rule in India. Thus Plainsted began the survey 
work of the coasts of Chittagang (1761) and Hugh Cameron, of the 24- 
Parganas. Rennell, who was appointed by Clive as the Surveyor-General, 
produced the first Map of Hindoostan in 1783. In the Madras Presidency, 
Robert Kelly and Michael Topping were the pioneers, and the latter also 
founded the Madras Observatory and a surveying school. Towards the 
close of the eighteenth century substantial progress was made in both the 
land and coastal surveys (10, pp. 493-94). 

Asiatic Society 

An event of far-reaching importance occurred in 1784 and that was 
the establishment of the Asiatic Society which in the subsequent years rose to 
be a learned society of pivotal importance not only for initiating and in- 
fluencing a number of scientific investigations but also establishing certain 
important scientific organizations. William Jones, the Founder-President 
of the Asiatic Society till his death in 1794, provided the initial stimuli so 
that the Society could make rapid progress towards its objective, namely, 
'Man and nature — whatever is performed by the one and produced by the 
other within the geographical limits of Asia’ (10, p. 495). 


NINETEENTH CENTURY 

In the history of modem science in India the nineteenth century is the 
most important period, for it was during these hundred years that there 
was a gradual expansion of the scientific pursuits in botany, geology, trigo- 
nometrical survey, meteorology, zoology, archaeology, etc., on the one 
hand and the establishment of the service organizations like the Trigono- 
metrical Survey, the Geological Survey and the Botanical Survey of India 
on the other. More importantly, the sdcntific and technical education 
received the necessary support and the first three Indian universities were 
established right at the time of the Indian Mutiny to be followed later by 
two other universities at Lahore and Allahabad. Telegraph and the rail- 
ways, too, made their appearance in the middle of this century and assumed 
an operative network soon. The closing decades of the century are more 
remarkable, for they heralded the dawn of scientific interests exhibited by 



602

the Indian intellectuals, some of whom made noteworthy contributions in 
the fields of mathematics, physics and chemistry. Indeed the progress in 
scientific endeavours in the nineteenth century was in tune with the general 
advancement of India, for as Majumdar says: *If we analyse the progress 
of Indian people during the nineteenth century, it will appear that there 
was hardly any aspect of fife and society which was not deeply affected by 
the western impact. The nineteenth century was a great dividing line, 
and these hundred years changed the face of India far more than did the 
preceding thousand years.’* 

Trigonometrical Survey 

The political necessities and exigencies of the East India Company 
demanded a thorough geographical knowledge of the country under its 
occupation. Though Topping and Rennel in the Madras Presidency had 
conducted a systematic survey work earlier, it was William Lambton, an 
outstanding geographer and geodesist as he was, who brought in the trigono- 
metrical survey, and his scientific mapping of southern India using geodetic 
instruments (which included chains, pickets, theodolite and a zenith sector, 
the last being still preserved in the Victoria Memorial Hall at Calcutta) 
was to serve as a foundation for a general survey of the whole country. 
When his results with detailed explanations were published, it was soon 
realized that 'a survey was proceeding in India that would yield geodetic 
results of the highest importance to science’. In 1818 came into being the 
Great Trigonometrical Survey of India. George Everest, who worked as 
surveyor under Lambton, undertook later the survey of North India and 
became Surveyor-General of India and Superintendent of the Great Trigo- 
nometrical Survey in 1830. As a result of a network of first quality survey 
work, the Himalayan region was explored, the highest peak in the world 
was discovered and rightly named after Everest. In 1 878, the trigonometrical, 
topographical and the revenue surveys were clubbed under the title, Survey 
of India. Colonel Waugh and Major-General Walker were the other two 
distinguished surveyors of India. To Radhanath Sikdar belongs the honour 
of the first Indian to have worked with Everest in the survey work and the 
associated mathematical applications and to have won his master’s approba- 
tion. In 1864 Radhanath was elected a corresponding member of the Society 
of Natural History (Bavaria)— a rare distinction conferred by this society 
on a foreigner (10, pp. 507-14). 

Geological Survey 

The Geological Survey of India came into being in 1851 and was 
established as a Government Department in 1857. Thomas Oldham, who 
came to India in 1851 as Superintendent of Geological Survey, was solely

responsible for a systematic geological work which was, to begin with, 
confined to investigations of coalfields in the eastern and central India. 
H. B. Medlicott and the Blanford brothers (W. T. Blanford and H. T. 
Blanford) were the other noted geologists. Both Oldham and W. T. 
Blanford worked on the correlation and classification of peninsular forma- 
tion. The Blanford brothers and Theobald elucidated the origin of the 
Talchir boulder beds and Godwin-Austen discovered the oldest rocks in the 
Khasi and Jaintia hills in Assam. Some palaeontological studies were also 
undertaken by Falconer, Feistmantel, Lydekker adn Pilgrim. In 1875 a 
first-class medal was awarded to the Geological Survey of India for its 
exhibits at the Congress Internationale des Sciences Geographigues held at 
Paris. Apart from these investigations, the Geological Survey of India also 
studied the Indian earthquakes. Bairdsmith of the Bengal Engineers made 
observations on the general distribution of subterranean disturbing forces 
in operation throughout India. T. H. Holland discovered the hypersthene- 
bearing granatoid rocks in the Madras Province. P. N. Bose and P. N. 
Dutta were the two Indians who occupied covenanted posts and were 
known for their geological acumen. The former was the first to publish 
the study of micro-section as an aid to the study of rocks, and the latter was 
largely responsible for the present location of the Tata Iron and Steel Works 
at Jamshedpur. P. N. Dutta discovered the vast deposits of manganese 
ore in the Bhandara and Chindwara river valley (10, pp. 523-28). 

Botanical Investigations 

After the death of Roxburgh, Nathaniel Wallich undertook botanical 
investigations in Nepal, Assam, Penang, Singapore, etc., and classified his 
rich collections which became a veritable mine of information for the 
European botanists of the time. He donated some of his collections to 
the reputed Linnean Society in England and produced Plantae Asiaticae 
Rariores in 3 volumes with 300 coloured plates in 1832. The botany of 
the Himalayan region assumed importance and a number of species of 
plants were collected. The Botanic Garden at Calcutta as well as the one 
at Saharanpur grew in size, and in the former a herbarium of international 
repute took shape. The herbarium not only housed almost all the dried plant 
materials of the whole of the Indian subcontinent, Asia Minor, Europe 
and Australia but also maintained international exchanges of specimens. 
George King who became the Superintendent of the Garden in 1871 did 
great service in reorganizing it on a scientific basis. In 1890, when the 
present Botanical Survey was established, he was appointed as the first 
Director of the Survey, and later he became the Director of the famous 
Royal Botanic Garden at Kew in England. The scientific investigations 
of the Botanical Survey of India have been largely responsible for the 
growth on the Indian soil of such exotic plants as cinchona, rubber, tea, 
potato, coffee, certain fibrous plants, tobacco, etc., of commercial impor- 
tance (10, pp. 514-20).

Meteorology and other Physical Investigations 

In the beginning of the nineteenth century, the importance of studies 
in weather, cyclone, tides, etc., was keenly felt. Some meteorological 
observations were also made at the coastal towns. The efforts were con- 
tinued and, between 1865 and 1871, several provincial meteorological organi- 
zations came into being and to consolidate their work was established the 
India Meteorological Department in 1875. Preparation of daily weather 
charts, issuing cyclone warnings, seismological studies, solar physics, and 
terrestrial magnetic studies were among the important functions of this 
department. As early as in 1834 India participated in the global study of 
the earth’s magnetism organized by the Gottingen Magnetic Union to 
record the simultaneous magnetic observations at 50 stations, of which 
three were in India. A magnetic observatory was already in existence in 
1826 at Colaba in Bombay and was later shifted to Alibag in view of the 
introduction of the electric traction for the street tram since then, lest the 
electric current should vitiate the magnetic observations. In 1895 the 
foundation of the solar physics laboratory was laid at Kodaikanal and it 
started functioning in 1900. Spectroscopic work, hydrogen content of the 
solar prominences, spectrum of the night sky, etc., were the important 
investigations undertaken in the laboratory ( 10 , pp. 501-507). As regards 
geophysics, Basevi and Ms co-workers observed the gravity anomalies in 
the Himalayan region, and these were interpreted mathematically by A. Pratt, 
as a result of wMch the theory of isostatic compensation emerged. 

Indian Museum 

The Asiatic Society wMch continued to play an effective role in en- 
couraging scientific investigations into the natural Mstory of the country 
gave a lead in the direction of antiquarian studies. TMs provided the initial 
stimulus for the Indian archaeology and the Archaeological Survey of India 
was started in 1860 with Cunningham as the first Surveyor. 

The Society had already accumulated a number of materials and 
curios wMch included ancient relics, coins, plant specimens and minerals as 
a result of investigations conducted by the members of the Society, and it 
was realized that they deserved preservation. Besides, the Society had 
under its care the government’s collection of minerals, fossils and the like 
under the name of Museum of Economic Geology (1840). Time was ripe 
for the establishment of a well-planned museum in Calcutta and the initiative 
taken by the Society resulted in the establishment of the Indian Museum 
in 1867. The scientific staff of the Indian Museum made valuable contri- 
butions to zoology and brought out a number of zoological notes and 
volumes relating to birds, mammalia, reptiles, moUusca, lepidoptera, 
fishes and the like ( 10 , pp. 528-30). 

Scientific and Technical Education 

The two institutions wMch came into being in the last two decades of 
the eighteenth century, viz. the Calcutta Madrasah (1781) and the Benares

Sanskrit College (1791), sought to encourage only the indigenous system of 
education including medicine and arithmetic. In 1813, when the East 
India Company’s charter was renewed, a clause was introduced to the 
effect that a sum of not less than one lac of rupees might be spent 'for the 
introduction and promotion of the knowledge of the sciences among the 
inhabitants of the British territories in India*. In 1817 was established at 
Calcutta the Mahdvidyalaya, ‘Seminary for the instructions of the sons of 
the Hindus in the European and Asiatic languages and sciences’, by some 
enlightened gentlemen including David Hare and Raja Rammohan Roy. 
The need for educating the Indian students in modern science and in the 
medium of English was brought home to the British Government in no 
unmistakable terms by Rammohan Roy. William Bentinck, Macaulay 
and Dalhousie were among the principal administrators who contributed to 
the growth and spread of scientific education. The Wood’s Despatch of 
1854 made possible the creation of the universities on the model of the 
London University, and with the establishment of the three universities at 
Calcutta, Bombay and Madras in 1857, the scientific and technical education 
in India assumed a definite form. The universities, however, were only 
the affiliating and examining bodies. As the administrative exigencies of 
the government demanded the employment of local doctors and engineers, 
some engineering and medical institutions were also established, and in- 
structions were imparted at two levels in colleges and schools. The notable 
institutions were the engineering colleges at Sibpur (Calcutta), Poona and 
Roorkee; medical colleges at Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, Victoria 
Jubilee Technical Institute at Bombay, School of Industrial Arts at Madras, 
agricultural and veterinary schools at a number of places in the three 
presidencies. Towards the close of the nineteenth century there were 
about 170 colleges including four medical and an even number of en- 
gineering colleges, and a number of technical schools affiliated to the five 
universities, which were offering courses in scientific subjects, medicine, 
engineering, agriculture and certain crafts ( 10 , pp. 541-56). 

A remarkable feature of the last two decades of the nineteenth century 
was that the Indian bright students came forward to take up independent 
investigations even in mathematical and physical sciences. Asutosh 
Mukheiji, J. C. Bose and P, C. R^y were well known for researches in 
mathematics, physics and chemistry respectively ( 10 , pp. 556-60). In par- 
ticular, J. C. Bose devised his own experiments with great ingenuity and 
displayed a new spirit of inquiry. P, C. R§y became the founder of what 
has come to be known as the Indian Chemical School and leader of the 
Indian chemical industry. What is more, the importance of modem 
science as a new and purposeful way of understanding was increasingly 
realized, and local attempts were initiated for the promotion of scientific 
investigations and diffusion of scientific knowledge. The Indian Association 
for the Cultivation of Science was established by Mahendra Lai Sircar in 
1876, through public endowments, with the object of promoting scientific 
interests. The physical investigations conducted by C. V. Raman later at

this Association enabled him to have the distinct honour of being the first 
Indian to receive the Nobel Prize for Physics. 

At the end of the nineteenth century the emergent picture revealed the 
growing interest in modem science evinced by the Indian students, the 
government’s keen desire to reform the universities enabling them to take up 
teaching as well as research and an enlargement of the area of involvement 
of the government, educationists, industrialists and philanthropists in laying 
a solid foundation for the growth of modem science and technology in India.
